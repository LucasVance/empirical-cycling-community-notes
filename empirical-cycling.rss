      <itunes:summary>In this episode we recap the big lessons from the last Watts Doc episode and revisit pacing endurance rides in terms of RPE, power, and heart rate, and finding that first threshold. Then we spend a long while considering how to program endurance rides into low, medium, and high volume weeks which we roughly block into &lt;10h, about 15h, and &gt;20h and the considerations we have for each scenario. Then we answer your listener questions on HR zones, the talk test, fueling endurance rides, cadence, whether you should do the occasional high volume week when the opportunity arises, and more.</itunes:summary>

We discuss normalized power, what kind of fitness CTL can actually reflect, and answer listener questions.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Does your training zone determine the fiber type used? Does fiber type determine aerobic or anaerobic pathways, carbs or fats? We answer these questions by looking at evidence and concepts that show that fast twitch fibers can be just as aerobically capable as slow twitch fibers, nearly as good at burning fats, and why that might be. We dissect a paper on elite cross-country skiers, and another paper on whether or not fast twitch fibers had been recruited at relatively low intensity. In-depth discussion follows on fiber type distribution, muscle mass recruitment and force availability, why endurance athletes defy the expected metabolic properties of fast twitch fibers, and why these expectations may have started with cats.</itunes:summary>

We conclude with practical considerations about what threshold means, and why power meters are our best way to measure it.</itunes:summary>

VO2max questions include:
Aspects of position like standing and TT bikes.
Transfer of heart adaptations to normal cadence riding.
The right cadence, pacing, and terrain for intervals, rest intervals.
How Kolie would structure VO2max training for thousands of cyclists at a time.
What 30/15s (and other intermittent intervals) do better than raise VO2max.
Periodizing VO2max through a season.
What does it take to make your training adaptations your &quot;new normal&quot;?</itunes:summary>

Ways to change your cadence, interval times, rest times, and interval intensities are discussed. Then we take apart a Ronnestad study on 30/15s and put it in context of VO2max and other fitness adaptations. We conclude with a training philosophy discussion on the physiology of true long term VO2max improvements.​​</itunes:summary>
