We have the Instagram AMAs happening also on the weekends. So I've been getting to them a little late. Sorry about that. Technically, it is still the weekend when I post this. So it was like yesterday at like nine o'clock. So it was still Sunday, still technically the weekend. I'm going to say it counts. So give me a follow at Empirical Cycling if you want to participate in that, or you can just watch and read and hang out and check it out. So what is this episode? What are we doing? Well, what we're talking about today is we're going to be talking about resources for coaches and self-coach athletes and just people who are interested in this kind of stuff. adaptation of physiology and kind of how it all connects to cycling. And the answer that I've given just about everybody is unfortunately it doesn't really exist. So if you're hoping for more stuff like the Wattstock episodes in the podcast, there's not a single resource out there that does it. There are resources that by their titles would seem to do it. For instance, there's a book called Molecular and Cellular Exercise Physiology by Morin and Volker, and it would seem to be the right thing. And one of the things that I did when I got this book is I opened up to the sections where I had already made some conclusions about the connection between these two things. And, you know, there wasn't enough information on those things. to reach a conclusion. And I will be talking about this book in a little bit. So forgive me, I'll circle back around to it. Because what we're going to get to is a bunch of literature recommendations and a bunch of recommendations on training philosophy and research philosophy as well. So I think that's very important to think about. So as you develop your own perspective on this kind of stuff, because as much fun as it would be for me to get a bunch of carbon copies of myself running around. Actually, that wouldn't be fun at all. I don't think anybody would enjoy that, honestly. So what I think I can help instruct people to do right here and now is to help develop your training philosophy and your research philosophy when it comes to all this stuff, like I said. So let's get started with my... Well, obviously, I'm going to have to put this in my... Catch it in my context, since I don't know how you're going to... really develop your own philosophy. So my philosophy is top-down and bottom-up. Now, this was asked to me, I forget what exactly the question was, but my answer was that I've got two training philosophies, top-down, which is the training intervention, and therefore we see results, and the bottom-up is adaptation, the cellular stuff, and therefore we should modify the training this way and that way. So that's bottom-up to me. And it was asked on That Triathlon Show, episode 271, I think it was. So go check that out if you want to hear more of me blabbing. And thank you, Michael, by the way, for having me on. I really liked that show. So it was great to be on. So go check that out. I will leave a link in the show notes on empiricalcycling.com. So one of the things that I think people are really asking me when they ask me about this kind of thing is for more of the bottom up. type approach or what I've been calling the bottom-up approach, the cellular physiology, the nitty-gritty, and how do we change our training to maximize this aerobic signal because that's going to allow us to produce more power to yada, yada, yada, meet our goals. This episode actually, because of how 10-Minute Tips is, I think, shifting, 10-Minute Tips is really shifting to being the top-down approach. So it's really going to be the more practical side of things. the dealing with all the phenomenology, I know I'm probably not using that word right, I'm sorry again philosophers, of the kind of stuff, the emergent things that we can have a good understanding of and a practical day-to-day understanding of without necessarily needing to know all the physiology. So why is this episode 10-minute tips? Because this is that approach to developing a bottom-up approach. Now the question is, how do we develop How do we develop this bottom-up philosophy ourselves? And not only, you know, not just copying mine, but, you know, building your own. And I think that the first way to do this, the best way to start is by learning cell bio. Now, why is this? Because the cell is the fundamental unit of... of what makes us. Inside a cell is homeostasis and outside a cell is just absolute chaos, just unmitigated disaster in the universe. And our cells are these happy little places where they have energy requirements and they have redox environments. They have all these things that they try to keep happy in order to maintain life. And when we exercise, we kind of disturb that and they have to adapt to deal with it. And that's really... is the basis of training. And, you know, systems fizz is going to be in here a little bit too. And so, you know, it's not just cells, but it's how the cells that make up the organs and yada, yada, yada. So you can see how fundamental this kind of thing is. And so in a cell bio class or in a cell bio textbook, you know, if you're one of those people who can read a textbook, I used to do that thing. I don't anymore because it really, really tries my patients. and I keep eyeing other books on the side like, hey, you look like your narrative. So that kind of stuff can get rough. But I can also suggest that you take a course. There are a lot of very good courses that you can take for free. There are also a lot of good courses that you can pay for. So it's really just a time investment and can sometimes be a financial investment. Depends on how far you want to take that kind of thing. You can enroll in classes. It's up to you. You know, again, is that when you get into a cell bio course, you're going to learn about the structure of the cell, you're going to learn about the organelles, you're going to get more up-to-date information than, for instance, if you just got like an old 10, 20-year-out-of-date cell bio textbook. because I remember in high school, we didn't know about peroxisomes. Now we know about peroxisomes. When I was in college, that was a new organelle to me. I hadn't heard of it. I got to learn about it. And that was really cool to see that the field is evolving. And it is always evolving. So in a way, textbooks are always kind of playing catch up, but it's impossible to keep up with all the literature. So a textbook that's within the last 10 years, I would suggest, is probably where you want to go if you want to go with that kind of thing. It's also one of those fields like unlike Newtonian physics, you know, physics 101 where you learn, you know, GMM over R squared, that kind of thing. That kind of stuff has been the same since what the 1600s or something like that. Well, it's been the same for everybody for the beginning of the universe, I guess. But it's not like that in cell bio. It's not like that in biology or biochemistry or anything like that. So that is why I suggest that that is the fundamental unit of understanding for you is cell bio. So if you've got that and you're not going to be intimidated by things like transcription factors or ribosomes or the typical RNA, mRNA, you know what those kinds of things are, then you can go on to the next step and you can start to specialize. So I'm going to very briefly talk about an area that I think would be cool to specialize in, but I know nothing about. So we're going to touch on this briefly, which is molecular bio and genetics. Now this field has... really kind of exploded into bioinformatics in a lot of ways. There's still a lot of old school genetics, the way I would recognize them, the way I learned about the old genetics experiments, like Jacques Monod and all that kind of stuff, doing experiments with bacteria and, you know, having to sequence genes in a very rough manner, that kind of thing. is where I'm familiar with it. And a lot of the new stuff on information databases, I've looked at that, and I think it's really cool. I just don't know what to do with all that information. So maybe one of you out there knows a lot more about that kind of stuff than I do, and that would be really phenomenal. And if you're becoming an expert, I'd love to have you on the podcast to talk about it. So now we get into another area. This is where I've spent my last 10 or 11 years thinking and learning. So this is biochemistry and metabolism. So this includes things like enzymes, things like metabolic pathways, obviously. It includes the structures of proteins and how their function comes out of the structure. Catalysis Mechanisms, so how these things actually perform what they do and how they lower activation energy for reactions. This kind of stuff is great. And it also will teach you about things like enzyme kinetics, which are very, very necessary if you want to really dig into some of the literature on this kind of stuff. This is where I think most people would want to go if you are going to be going through this route. So in order to learn more about this, I suggest, again, any kind of textbook, although this is really kind of hard stuff if you are not used to it, or also if you don't have a good organic chemistry background. So this is where a book like the Molecular and Cellular Exercise Physiology book that I mentioned earlier by Morin and Volker I'm flipping through it right now and it starts with basic cell stuff. You know, mechanical stimuli and membrane traffic. This is, you know, chapter one. Cellular lifespan, chapter two. Then, you know, some basic stuff. Then, you know, more and more and more into structure. And then exercise, et cetera, et cetera. So this is, you know, kind of a book where... You can learn some of that stuff, you can pick it up, but you're not going to pick up the real technical details, and so you're always going to be kind of on the back foot if you really want to have a deeper understanding of this kind of stuff. And which is not to, you know, toot my own horn that I do understand this stuff a little better. I'm certainly not a world-class expert on it. I am somebody with an undergraduate degree, and I've continued my own education since, so I don't know how qualified that makes me for anything. but you know I can certainly tell you that this is the kind of stuff where once I kind of had my foothold into biochemistry and metabolism and cell structure and cell bio and protein structure and mechanics all this kind of stuff makes it very very I wouldn't say easy but it makes most scientific literature more interpretable so you can pick up a paper and You know, you can go through the experiment and you can kind of get a sense of what's happening, why it's happening, and if there are any kind of things that maybe, especially in exercise physiology literature, that the authors might be missing in terms of the biochemistry and, you know, the reasoning of things happening. So for instance, a lot of the time when I see... you know like I think Wattstock number nine is a good example of this where you know we kind of looked at a paper that was looking at people endurance athletes doing strength training and it improves their like 20 minute time trial power or something like that and their view to max didn't go up so we want to figure out why does this happen and the authors were thinking you know it's something to do with maximal strength and yada yada and I had a different interpretation and that's the kind of thing that you will would be able to do with this kind of background where you can kind of push back against an author's interpretation of their own study. And it's not to say I'm right and they're wrong, although I think I am, but, you know, and it's not to, you know, not to denigrate, you know, those researchers because this is one of those things where if traditional, to me at least, and this is... This is a little bit of a judgment call on my part. I'm happy to be wrong about it, but it seems like a lot of the time in traditional exercise physiology education, the more fundamental biochemistry type stuff that I use to have a strong critique of methodology is not emphasized enough, I guess we could say. So from there, I think you are in a good position to go one of many directions. So I suggest that you start with some books like Molecular and Cellular Exercise Physiology. You can also get a book like Exercise Physiology by, let's see, who is this? That is McArdle Catch and Catch. So that is a pretty decent book on just general exercise physiology. You could go for a book like Exercise Physiology by Brooks Fahey and Baldwin. Now that is a much more technical book. I've actually pulled from it for a bunch of podcasts and I have about like 10 like sticky notes in it for markers. You can also go into other books like Advanced Cardiovascular Exercise Physiology from, that's the Human Kinetics Press. things like that or you know you can actually go for older literature one of the things that I like to do in my spare time if this is a thing that anybody does it would be me I guess to read older papers so for instance I have a book from Huxley called Reflections on Muscle. And I haven't read it yet, but this is a book that I'm very much looking forward to reading. So I like to look at older scientists and their perspectives on their experiments because a lot of the time this kind of memoirs from these scientists directly do not pull any punches in terms of technical literature because in terms of technical terminology. They do not pull any punches in terms of technical terminology because they expect that their audience is going to be other scientists and other educated folks or folks educated in that way, I should say. And so from there, you know, there are other specific books that you might want to take a look at, like Cycling Science from Chung and Zabala, also from Human Kinetics, sorry, Zabala. And you can pretty much kind of go any direction you want from here. literally looking at my bookshelf on my desk here and reading off book titles of things that I have referenced a lot. But there are other things that you can do now that you have a solid foundation. You can get into other branches of science. I actually have a lot of books on developmental biology and genetics and mathematical modeling in biology. I also have books on sexual selection and evolutionary biology. I also have books on just kind of, you know, neural stuff, like how the brain works. Yeah, and quite honestly, you don't know if it's going to help you when you go to doing the next thing. But I've always found that reading widely, being interested in a lot, will give you a broader foundation regardless of if you're going to build on it or not. It just helps to have it, I find. yeah and the other thing you can do from here is you can just start to read papers I have let's see how big is this file I have approximately a gigabyte worth of scientific papers that I've read most of them. And I've got a couple as I skimmed them and I was like, all right, I'll get back to this. So I've got those in a separate folder. And this is just something that you accumulate over time where you have a question, you think, oh, I wonder if, for instance, blood lactate concentration at maximal lactate steady state or FTP is always four millimolar for the population. So you start to Google that kind of thing. What is blood lactate concentration at maximum lactate steady state? And then you can look at Google Scholar and you can look in PubMed and you can start to read different papers and find, you know, do people actually have a different concentration or is it like about 4 millimoles, 3.8 to 4, 4.1? Is this about the population average? And so now you start to have a better idea of the scientific literature on this kind of thing, and you can interpret it, you can read a paper easily, and you can start to make your own judgment calls. And this is the kind of thing that I've been doing for a long time, or I've been thinking about for a long time anyway, which is being critical of how something can be applied to an athlete individually. And so this is, I guess, the last piece of the 10-minute tips for coaches today, which is... Having a training philosophy and having a working model of physiology that is broadly applicable to every single individual. So to me, if I cannot take a thing that I've learned and apply it individually to each athlete and have something in that framework, of this concept like maximal lactate steady state. Like if I'm looking at somebody's blood lactate and we're doing a step test, so I would have somebody do like 10 minutes at X watts, then X plus 25, plus 25, or so many watts per kilo and then add a quarter watt per kilo or something like that. So doing stuff like this and looking at blood lactate, now I can see, I don't just have to think, okay, what is the power output at four millimoles? Does four millimoles mean something to every athlete? Yes and no. You know, we can track it over time, but also at the same time, you know, it doesn't necessarily mean that that's their maximum lactate steady state because now we know that people vary in this kind of thing. And the same thing goes for LT1 and the same thing goes for markers for VO2max. You know, you have certain things that you need to make sure apply to everybody. Or, you know, to me, these kinds of things are not good metrics. As you learn and as you interpret the literature and as you try to apply it to athletes, you need to be careful not to over-interpret and you also need to be careful to question every assumption that you make. So I've done a couple of consults now where people have been looking for, for instance, their blood lactate concentration at MLSS and they just assume it's 4 millimole. And so if you have a blood lactate concentration under 4 millimole, at maximum lactate steady state. What you think is your FTP at four millimoles is actually going to be over your FTP. And this is going to be a very, very, very dark time for training for you because, you know, your interval sets are going to be nearly impossible because you're always riding over threshold where fatigue accumulates so much faster and you deplete yourself so much faster. So you are really, really digging a hole and you have this perception that, oh, this is what the scientific literature says, but, you know, you're... on-bike perceptions. So your top-down perceptions, we could say here, are in conflict with the scientific learning and making the two merge rather than having one override the other. Actually, personally, I would rather have the top-down thing. Always override the bottom-up approach. So if you think that it's not your FTP, if this doesn't feel right, if it feels too hard, or LT1, I've done a couple of consults like this in the last couple of weeks too, also. where people are looking at blood lactate at 2 millimole and assuming that's their LT1. And in fact, it's not because blood lactate concentration varies again here. So people are always riding way too hard for what they think they should be doing because what they think they should be doing is riding at this power output because science says so. And in fact, they are riding suboptimally because they are gathering so much fatigue. It's really just one of those things where you have to merge the two. You have to let... One thing override the other. If this doesn't feel right, I need to question my assumptions. And this, a lot of the time, does mean that some of what's been put out in the scientific literature is, you know, just not that it's incorrect, but a lot of the time it's that it looks at population averages that cannot be applied to individuals. So being able to apply something to each individual, having that standard, having that understanding. How People Vary, this is really, really important. And this is probably the final piece to put into your own training philosophy as a coach. And being able to question things like, oh, this paper did not find a statistically significant difference between MLSS and critical power or something like that. But, you know, that doesn't necessarily mean that... The two are the same thing, for instance. So, you know, being able to question these assumptions because, you know, for instance, if you test your critical power, you've got a lot of anaerobic capacity, you might way overshoot your FTP by 30, 40 watts, and now you've got a problem. And so you need to develop your own standard of what works and your own standard of questioning assumptions. And now that you have this background, And really, it all comes back around to the fundamentals. It all comes back around to, you know, is this a very sustainable practice? This is very 10-minute tipsy now because we're thinking about how does the athlete feel? How's the fatigue? Is this too much fatigue? Should they be able to hit these numbers? If yes, okay, great. If not, what's happening? Is it under fueling? Is it under sleeping? Is it training suboptimally? Do we need to look at this person's training zones or levels? That's the kind of thing where you have to start making your own judgments. So I hope all that makes sense to everybody because, you know, I think a lot of the time that we get lost with all of the big fancy physiology stuff. And a lot of the time, if we really just focus on the fundamentals, I mean, I'm not kidding when I tell people that a lot of my job, I would say 60 to 70% of it is asking people if they've had enough to eat or had enough sleep or if they're stressed. It all comes down to fundamentals a lot of the time. And to me at least, the integration of this kind of stuff into a normal coaching philosophy, it's not to base your coaching philosophy on it, it's to tweak. It's not to develop anything that's earth-shattering because really there's not much earth-shattering stuff out there. There's not a lot of shortcuts. There's not a lot of silver bullets. And I would say... Somebody asked me this on a forum recently, and I had to say that my secret sauce stuff, I think it probably speeds up some development times by like maybe 10 or 20%. Maybe, honestly, maybe more like five. And so a lot of the time, the fancy stuff is really just speeding up the process. The process is still long, still takes forever. And learning all the physiology in the world, You know, you can have all that knowledge, but you can still... not be a good coach and not to put anybody down for that kind of stuff because these people would be scientists who are doing the research and are not coaching anybody actively not to say they wouldn't be good coaches if they didn't want to be so it's just a matter of what they're doing and their experience so I hope this helps everybody I kind of laid out the path that I took but that doesn't mean you have to take the same path and I think that generally speaking if you're in the cycling world already you are a very or probably a very internally motivated person. And, you know, this kind of stuff doesn't happen overnight. And it's not even to say that you need to do this stuff, that you need to have this knowledge to become a good coach. I do not think that is the case. And it doesn't mean you have to have this knowledge to become a good coach of yourself. It just seems to me that a lot of folks, when they start learning some of the deeper understanding things where they see... you know for instance companies or individuals that have a certain training philosophy they're putting it out there I think this happens because x y and z It's easy to feel like you've got to keep up with the Joneses with this kind of stuff. Oh, I need to learn this kind of thing. I need to learn about why this happens. I need to learn X, Y, and Z. Therefore, I will be a better coach for it. And that may be the case, but it also may not be the case. Because if it means that you are skipping out on learning the fundamentals of coaching, of dealing with people and dealing with fatigue and dealing with training load and perception and things like that, Then I think you can miss the forest for the trees a lot of the time. So I really want to emphasize that especially, that coaching and training is as much about the person as it is about the underlying physiology. And you can train somebody... towards the underlying physiology. You can kind of teach to the test as it were. You can have certain markers going up, but really at the end of the day, you also need to see the results. You also need to see an athlete who is happy with the training and happy with the results. And also that on race day that, you know, they can do it. And just because also... you know the other way around just because somebody has a good race just because somebody is happy with the results doesn't mean that you've done it perfectly this time because that is almost certainly always not the case and so You know what? Screw it. I wasn't going to plug myself on this, but why not? If you've made it this far into this podcast, you're probably a coach or a very serious self-coach who's listening to my ramblings. And if you want to set up a consultation with me, I do consult with a lot of coaches. I also have ongoing consultations with a lot of coaches. And so, you know, obviously your anonymity is assured. I know a lot of people don't want to be seen to not know some things. certainly understand that. I've had that impulse in me also, so I get it. You can consult with me on an ongoing basis or in a one-off basis if you'd like to shoot me an email, empiricalcyclingatgmail.com, and we can arrange that. And if there's anything that you want to consult with that I don't know about, I will be perfectly upfront and say, I don't think I can help you with this problem. But generally, that seems to not be the case, and we can work something out and we can talk. Having said all that, I hope this was a help. You know, I actually just got an email this morning from the latest person to ask me this very question about what resources are out there for X, Y, and Z. You know, I threw out one of the books and I said, you know, you can look at this one. Oh, this is way over my head. And so if you want to interpret this kind of thing, this is kind of the pathway that I'm laying out for you here. you know sends me in this question I'm probably going to refer you to this very podcast the other thing that I'm going to do also is on the empiricalcycling.com website I'm going to go into my library if you go into education and empirical cycling library that is a collection of all the books I have and I probably still have a bunch to fill in that I haven't put up yet I'm going to bold the ones that I think you know have you know if it's not even if it's not the one that you look at like myself biotextbook which is out of date I suggest you don't get that I'm still going to bold it you know those are going to be the books or the educational topics where I think if you are going to try to kind of Develop your understanding of cellular biology and all that kind of stuff. Those are going to be at least topics that you should look up. And I will also bold all of the books that I think do a decent job kind of bridging the gap between the science and the performance, even though there are still a lot of bridges that need to be made. between the theory and the application and just going in knowing that you are not going to find all the answers that you want and you're going to have to go digging yourself. So I hope that helps everybody.
