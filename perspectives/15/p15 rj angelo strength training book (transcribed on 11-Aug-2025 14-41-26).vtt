Subscribe to the podcast. You all know that the important stuff is, of course, sharing the podcast. If you like what you're hearing here, we love to see that people are referencing the podcast and linking to it in forums and just wherever. We really appreciate that. And thanks, everybody, for coming to say hi at all the races. Kyle and I really appreciate that and all the guests that we've had on who have come and said that people have come up.

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:35.840
said hi to them. So we really appreciate that. Thank you, everybody. So we have

00:00:35.840 --> 00:01:01.952
of course no ads so we are ad free so if you'd like to donate to the podcast you can do so at empiricalcycling.com slash donate we've got some show notes up on the website we will have a couple for today and of course if you have any coaching or consultation inquiries because of course don't forget we are a cycling coaching company that is our thing you can reach out to me at empiricalcycling at gmail.com we do consultations as well and of course don't forget to follow along on Instagram at empiricalcycling

00:01:01.952 --> 00:01:19.968
for weekend AMAs, up in the stories, and all sorts of fun stuff in between, doing some memes in the regular stuff, and putting up some training files and stuff like that. I think people have been enjoying those, so if you'd like to... The last one was how to recovery ride and how not to recovery ride.

00:01:19.968 --> 00:01:44.176
So that's up there too. And we're probably not going to have a podcast up next week. That is the week of Elite Road Nats in the US and also in Canada. So I apologize for that and have a bunch of riders there. And so we'll probably not have a podcast there. And then I'm moving. So I will be having a really fun time for the week after next.

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:58.560
But yeah, then we'll be back on our regular schedule. So thank you everybody for your patience and check up on Instagram. I'll probably do an extra AMA at EliteNats whenever I get a free moment. So check that out.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:25.072
On today's podcast we have Angelo Gingerelli and we have RJ Borgers who are a couple of strength and conditioning coaches who also do endurance events and their primary thing is strength and conditioning coaching and so they reached out to me about a book they wrote called Finish Strong Resistance Training for Endurance Athletes and they said do you want to check out the book and you know if you think it's okay maybe we'll come on the podcast and talk about it so I read the book

00:02:25.072 --> 00:02:50.784
and I thought the book was really good in parts and I thought the book had a couple spots where I had some questions and so they came on the podcast and we had a really good and interesting discussion so I hope everybody listening you know here's the discussion and you know if you want to get the book we will have a link up on Amazon up to the Amazon place where you can buy it so

00:02:50.784 --> 00:03:16.320
Yeah, if you want that, that's great. And also, I apologize again. The audio quality on this interview is really bad compared to what you are used to. I am going to clean it up as best I can, but I'm just going to apologize ahead of time. There is some obvious noise gating. There's some background hissing. And my microphone decided to not work that day for some reason. So I don't know what the deal is with that.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:39.888
So if you will excuse all of those things, I hope it doesn't sound too badly. If you're on a bike ride and you've got the conduction headphones and whatnot, it might not sound amazing. So sorry about that. But I thought it was a really cool discussion. I really appreciate RJ and Angelo for coming out to the podcast and I'll see you on the other side of the interview. Thanks for sending me the book, by the way.

00:03:39.888 --> 00:04:09.776
So I read it cover to cover as promised. I have several pages of notes that I took while I was reading. I think we have some points of agreement. I think we have some points of disagreement. And I think that's going to make interesting discussion because I like to just give people tools and then let them make their own decisions. So I'm sure you guys kind of got that sense through the podcast before, right? For sure. And we actually appreciate that because

00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:30.288
It's a pretty boring podcast if everyone is in agreement and just going, yep, you're right, you're right. I think it's a little healthier when there's a little bit of a discussion and a little bit of back and forth. I think there's more to get out of it for the audience, for sure.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:54.224
Yeah, so the book kind of went into it, but why don't you guys tell me about your background in strength training and also endurance training? Like, do you guys coach endurance athletes or just strength? Or like, I know you guys both do endurance events. So where do you all come from? Go ahead, Ang. Okay, I'll go first. You're on my background. I've been a strength and conditioning coach for about 20 years.

00:04:54.224 --> 00:05:23.536
17 of which are at Seton Hall in New Jersey, right? So I work with all the sports in the department. Endurance-wise, men and women's cross-country and our distance swimmers are the ones that are the most analogous to what we wrote the book about, right? And I've been in that profession for a long time. Ten years ago, I ran a marathon and just got super into the marathon world, right? Right about that time, I met RJ. He was in the marathon triathlon world. We started training together, and we're lifting together, running together, and he's...

00:05:23.536 --> 00:05:49.504
way better at the running and swimming than I am, but we kind of worked out together, kind of had this idea that his background in athletic training, my background in strength and conditioning, and we had a lot of people talking, I was like, well, how do I insert this lifting into my workout and my daily routine? So we got together and put this in the book we're going to talk about today. So for me, I've always been doing some level of strength training since graduating college. It's just one of those things that...

00:05:49.504 --> 00:06:15.488
It's an outlet that makes me feel good, get some endorphin release, a little stress relief, something that I think a lot of people can actually use. And then I started doing some 5Ks and things like that, really simple stuff in the early 2000s, and then finally stepped up to the triathlon world in about 2009. And then from there, everything just took off.

00:06:15.488 --> 00:06:44.736
I literally probably strength train five days a week. Still pretty much to this day. About the only thing that I change in that is probably substitute a yoga session in for one of those days. As I've gotten older, mobility has been a little bit more of an issue. As our body changes and hormones change and our tissues become a little bit more rigid.

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:53.952
We noticed that we were doing things a little bit different. We never miss a race. We always show up to the start line and we've got friends that...

00:06:53.952 --> 00:07:23.408
They have these overuse chronic conditions, and it's just so disappointing to see when they're not making it to the start line, and they're these talented individuals, they've put in all this time training, and then meanwhile they're not able to go and actually do the race. So we said, look, let's write a book about this, and this is an area that we think has been keeping us successful in what we do, and so we just kind of wanted to share it with everybody.

00:07:23.408 --> 00:07:50.976
So what inspired you to write a whole book? Because I think everybody who eventually becomes some kind of an expert in anything thinks, I should write a book. And then you look at what's involved in writing a book and then you go, fuck that. Why would I spend all that time? So what made you guys decide to actually

00:07:50.976 --> 00:07:56.592
I don't know just roll up your sleeves and get to work on this thing because I'm sure it took years.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:26.480
Speaking of everybody should write a book, I saw a stat recently that said 80% of the population thinks they can write a book, 1% actually produce a book. That seems to pass the eyeball test, right? That seems about right. I think the biggest thing that pushed us to actually pull the trigger and start the publication process was the amount of people in our lives that were asking us these kind of questions, right? We knew kind of early on that we had the knowledge, like you said, we're both 20 years deep in physical culture, if you will, in training for different

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.216
kind of events, but right around 2016-17, we were both, we were running together, lifting together, and I'd be like,

00:08:33.216 --> 00:09:02.576
Three people today asked me about should I lift weights if I'm a runner? I get emails all the time, how do you train your swimmers or your cross country kids? So we kind of realized there was a market out there for it of people that just didn't know how to implement this kind of training. And then that kind of forced us down the rabbit hole of pitching this to publishers and saying like, look, we're two guys that are a little bit rare that we strength train and we compete endurance athlete wise. And we have kind of the backgrounds and credentials behind us of experience plus multiple degrees. So we might be the guys that can actually help a lot of people.

00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:31.792
We're going to attack that a little bit different than if you're 18, correct? But we're going to just kind of look at our experience, come out with what we learned in the classroom in the academic setting, try to put out a book that obviously is not going to appeal to everybody, but I really believe if you're already in the endurance sport training

00:09:31.792 --> 00:09:43.312
I gotta tell you, when Angelo pitched me on the idea, he said, let's write a book. And I was like, oh no.

00:09:43.312 --> 00:10:12.832
I was like, I really don't want to do this. This is going to be a lot of work. Having written and submitted plenty of research manuscripts, I just know the time and effort to pull those together and then the rewrites. And I was just like, oh, this is going to be a major undertaking. Fortunately, at the time, I probably had, I was in a good spot in terms of the number of other

00:10:12.832 --> 00:10:36.272
extra commitments that I had. So it all kind of worked out. I was excited about the idea, but I was just like, oh man, this time commitment is going to be brutal. And it is. All right. So I think also what I want to ask you guys is what do you think makes the book unique? Because there are other, you know.

00:10:36.272 --> 00:11:03.984
Even beyond books, there's lots of media around strength training for endurance athletes. So besides your experience, because I think a lot of coaches like myself do a lot of endurance stuff and also lift weights. So what's your perspective that makes the book unique and more useful? Because my audience is, I would say, 90% competitive cyclists who race races and criteriums. So what do you bring to the table for them?

00:11:06.352 --> 00:11:12.112
I think one of the first things we did that and there's a lot of great resources out there. We are by no means the only

00:11:12.112 --> 00:11:41.488
book or Instagram account or YouTube channel out there on this kind of thing. A lot of them are really good. One thing we did from my particular point of view is we took the year and broke it down into four distinct seasons, right? So in my world where I'm training college athletes, there's very clearly an in-season, a pre-season, an off-season, a summer break, whatever it might be. A lot of adult endurance athletes don't look at the year that way, right? They just look at, I'm going to train these couple months with this race, then I'm going to take some time off to do it again. So we kind of broke the year down to four distinct segments and we kind of

00:11:41.488 --> 00:11:44.816
worked out different ways to work resistance training into each

00:11:44.816 --> 00:12:14.096
Season of the Year, if you will, right? Because one thing we see all the time, anecdotally, we see people start, quote unquote, training, and then we start running, lifting, mobility, or stretching all at the same time, and then they get incredibly sore, incredibly disgruntled, and a lot of times the lifting is the first thing they cut out, right? So we kind of put a plan together where you can introduce these new exercises during your off-season, and then give you ways to taper, cut back, plug and play different times of the year, where we keep resistance training, but do it in a way that's smart and gets you ready for your big events.

00:12:14.096 --> 00:12:42.608
I gotta agree with Angelo that I the thing when we looked at other books and other resources that are out there the main thing that we thought

00:12:42.608 --> 00:13:06.208
The failures that we've seen in other areas was the failure to periodize with your season. And it's actually hilarious, exactly what Angela was mentioning there about a lot of people start in the offseason, they'll do their lifting, and then all of a sudden they ramp up their endurance sport training, and then that falls by the wayside.

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:23.856
I'm giving a presentation to a group in Colorado tomorrow and the individual that I'm communicating with, he's like, yeah, so these are all triathletes. He's like, you got to tell them what they should be doing right now while they're in season. He's like, they all lift.

00:13:23.856 --> 00:13:50.944
out of season, but then they don't do it now. And I'm just like, oh God, that's the problem, you know? And so it just kind of gives, it validates the reason why we felt so strongly of putting that in there in the book and spending a good amount of time on it. Okay. Well, let me start digging in right there. So what do you think is the advantage of lifting in season for triathletes and competitive cyclists and whoever?

00:13:50.944 --> 00:14:15.184
And also, why do you think it gets cut out? Why is it the first thing to go? I think it gets cut out because of time. It's that time commitment that we always hear as being why it's the first thing to go. And most people sit there and say, well, if I don't have enough miles on the bike prior to my next...

00:14:15.184 --> 00:14:41.104
Prior to my next event, then clearly that's going to be the first thing to go because that's going to affect my cardiorespiratory fitness. Good. I get it. Makes sense. The thing that I think people are failing to see is the fact that the strength training is actually what's going to almost be the glue to holding you into your correct body postures and body mechanics.

00:14:41.104 --> 00:15:07.824
If you've ever seen someone in a road race, a Fondo, something like that, they look awesome in the beginning. They're riding that bike. They are locked in. You're not seeing a whole lot of hip or pelvis drop and pelvis lift. And then they might be climbing in a hill towards the end when they're really fatigued.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:26.576
A lot of the body mechanics fall apart. And when the body mechanics start to fall apart, you become less powerful. You're not going to perform optimally. Let's put it that way. Yeah. So in other words, you're saying that there's a lot more kinetic leak.

00:15:26.576 --> 00:15:53.360
That's probably a great way to put it in that you're giving away energy that could be there because of your poor mechanics and therefore becoming less effective. So what do you think is the mechanism where strength training helps that? Because I coach both strength and endurance and so I see something like that and my first thought is this person needs better endurance and this person probably needs to eat more.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:23.200
And then once we solve those things, I don't see people falling apart at the end of long races. So how do you think the strength training affects that? And what percentage might be strength training? What percentage might be just endurance and bonking related? Yeah, that's a great question. And I think nutrition definitely plays a factor into it, right? To say most of those athletes need to eat more, I think we all agree that's a sweeping generation that's true for a lot of us, right?

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:35.776
addressing mechanics. Totally agree that's a big percentage of people being inefficient on the bike, on the run, on the swim, whatever we're talking about. But I think to some extent we need to look at does being stronger help correct those mechanics.

00:16:35.776 --> 00:17:04.544
And that's where we can show somebody how to run and make them look perfect the first mile, how they look on mile 20, mile 30, mile 40, and I think developing that baseline strength with it in mind, how do we make this transfer onto the bike in this case, right? So for example, just being a big heavy back squatter and heavy deadlifter might not transfer as much as developing some strength in the lower extremity, developing some core strength and good posture in the shoulder girdle, and then go ahead and coaching them up when they're on the bike.

00:17:04.544 --> 00:17:29.952
Try to hold this position for as long as you can, right? So kind of give them a good idea of what looks right. And now, all right, you were doing good the first five miles. Now really think about staying in that position the next five miles. And now theoretically, with this newly improved strength and mobility, they should be able to hold that good technique and good form longer into the race. Because I know that there's a lot more research on strength training having a positive immediate impact on running economy.

00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:56.304
and not so much in cyclists that I see. And also when I coach cyclists, a lot of them, they, you know, we pretty much only, we're plugging leaks. Like if somebody's like shoulders get sore, okay, we'll address that, like stuff like that. But, you know, for a lot of folks, like if it ain't broke, don't fix it, you know? So what do you think is the real difference between like different sports even because like running and cycling and all of that? Yeah, the demand on a runner is...

00:17:56.304 --> 00:18:20.432
Way different than what it is on a cyclist because essentially every time that they're running, they're becoming a projectile and then they're having to absorb all of those forces. Whereas the cyclist is staying on the bike, so it's not an impact sport. So I think you've got, you know, a major difference right there. And so I think that it really becomes important.

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:29.120
for those that end up having to run. So if they're a triathlete and they're having to get ready for their run after they've been cycling for as long as they have.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:55.664
If they're fatigued and then they start going out on the run and then they start promoting a poor mechanic, you're going to start getting poor alignment and that becomes really problematic. I'm glad that you asked that question because by sport it's totally different and I think that's part of the thing why, as you're mentioning, for cyclists, people that are just a dedicated cyclist, I don't know if it's

00:18:55.664 --> 00:19:23.616
as needed. The one thing that I will say, and I know that you had mentioned that sometimes you'll see that when you look at the research articles, whether or not a resistance training program actually will help your performance. I would say I feel like it's about a 50-50 mix on those studies. Most of those studies are coming out of Scandinavia. And I always start to wonder, like,

00:19:23.616 --> 00:19:51.920
What made each of these cohorts that they were following different and why did they get those particular results? I'm a big fan of is there a systematic review or a meta-analysis that supports something? And I haven't seen anything like that in terms of someone synthesizing everything that's been written regarding the pros or cons of strength training for cyclists.

00:19:52.304 --> 00:20:22.224
Yeah, but if you want to look at high-intensity training meta-reviews, we've got our pick of the litter if we really want to. I want to keep digging into this a little bit more because I think one of the things I see with – because I usually recommend people cut out strength training as they get deeper into their season, especially when it becomes the difference between – fatigue management is a big one.

00:20:22.224 --> 00:20:43.472
I think a lot of people when they hit their squat PR before the season and whatnot and then they get in season and they go, oh my god, I don't want to get rid of all my strength gains. So what do you think is going on there with people's motivation to keep lifting or to either cut it out? I'm going to take this one.

00:20:43.472 --> 00:21:10.224
and correct me if I'm wrong, but, you know, with your demographic of folks that you're that you're training, mostly folks that are road racing, crits, cyclocross, you know, that's going to be that's a different that's a different event that you're prepping for compared to someone that is, you know, doing these long fondos doing some kind of.

00:21:10.224 --> 00:21:36.992
Ironman Triathlon, I think the events themselves are a little bit different. And I think the intensity that you ride those events is certainly going to be different. So if I'm riding more at a tempo pace throughout, staying at a nice tempo pace for an entire Ironman Triathlon, that's going to be totally different than what your folks are doing for

00:21:36.992 --> 00:22:06.624
for a crit or for a cyclocross race. And I think your training is going to be vastly different. So you're going to do a lot more VO2 max workouts. And I think that's part of the reason why you're saying that you're having to manage a lot more of the fatigue. You're hitting a lot higher intensities than I would say that some of the other folks that might be training. And so I agree with you that if you're

00:22:06.624 --> 00:22:29.424
You know, you might need to manage some of the fatigue factor if you're actually having folks that are actually, you know, exercising at such a high intensity for their training.

00:22:29.424 --> 00:22:53.968
Big Generalization. We recommend if your mileage or your distance or yards is tapering by, let's say, 20%, we're going to taper the weight room by 20% too, right? So instead of cutting down to zero, instead of doing sets of 10, maybe we're doing sets of 80. Instead of 100 pounds, we're lifting 80 pounds, right? Same idea, taper the weight room the way we do our endurance work. And we kind of allude this in the book a little bit. That's a good place to start, right? When we're talking about super high-end elite athletes,

00:22:53.968 --> 00:23:23.248
Hunderts of miles on a bike, we realize there might be a time where that needs to change. The one thing for beginners, even intermediate athletes, we kind of realize that if we're doing the right things in the weight room, we're training the right way, and working on our mobility, and we're feeling good doing that, right? Does it make sense to cut that out completely, do your big crazy, you know, not crazy, but very high intensity time of the year training-wise, and then have to get your body completely back into moving properly and feeling good again when it's over? We think we can find kind of a middle ground of, yes, taper the resistance training set.

00:23:23.248 --> 00:23:49.712
But keep moving and keeping your body balanced and mobile the way you've been doing it the entire training period and come back two or three days after the big race and be ready to go again and start the next training period. That's what I think did not come across to me as strongly as I was expecting it to reading the book. The whole time I was like, who's the target audience? Because it seems like it's a lot focused on...

00:23:49.712 --> 00:24:18.064
People who, uh, you know, who are super time crunch, like doing their triathlons and fondos and whatnot, uh, and not quite so much competitive cyclists. But then you're like, if you're doing a criteria and this is going to work. So I was like, that's curious. I got to ask these guys about this. Um, you know, cause, um, you know, cause, cause, cause, cause your answers here are much more, you know, what I would have expected to read in the book and I, I, I might've just missed it. Um, so I don't know if that's the job, that's just me.

00:24:18.096 --> 00:24:47.344
Probably poor reading comprehension. We appreciate you reading the book that closely. Thank you. We're up for constructive criticism on it. Was it perfect? No, it's not. You know, it's not perfect. But, you know, I think I think we're getting our point across to most individuals. And, you know, hopefully we hit hit the mark for for more people than than than less people. Let's put it that way.

00:24:47.472 --> 00:25:15.744
Yeah. All right. Because as I went through the book, let me check my notes here real quick. I think that one of the first things that I noticed is that just in terms of language, you talk about being strong quite frequently. And you never come out right and say it, which is wise, obviously, because they're not the same.

00:25:15.744 --> 00:25:42.304
The implication as I read it, like the subtext was that being strong in the weight room equates to having good endurance on the bike. And I think we just kind of touched on that in terms of like the biomechanics and kinetic leak and all of that stuff. But, you know, was that kind of intentional? Was that like an experiential thing? Is that like you guys notice this a lot when you're coaching athletes? I think as far as using the terminology we use.

00:25:42.304 --> 00:25:50.624
Between us and the editors over at Bloomberg that we worked with, the idea was to make it as digestible to the biggest...

00:25:50.624 --> 00:26:19.888
Part of the population is possible, right? So we can, on a show like this, where you do a great job of breaking down the science of training, we can debate the definition of strong and explain it to your listeners a little better than we can of book that development in Barnes & Noble and kind of for everybody, right? Let's talk about the different types of strong there are. So give me, why don't you guys give me your definitions on strong in the weight room and strong in the bike and how they overlap and how they're different. Or you want to take it first a little better on the bike than me.

00:26:19.888 --> 00:26:47.824
Obviously, people are going to talk FTP, right? So what's your FTP? How well are you able to hit your training zones and ride against other folks? And then strong in the weight room is, yeah, maybe you can push and maybe you have a good back squat, a 300-pound back squat, something like that.

00:26:47.824 --> 00:27:16.992
I don't know that that's necessarily going to translate. I will say, though, that if you are doing your strength training routinely, then A, it's going to keep your body healthy and hopefully in a proper alignment. So that should actually keep you out on the bike competing in your sport. Will it translate to more power to the pedal? I don't know.

00:27:16.992 --> 00:27:38.432
And I think we'd be crazy to say with some kind of absolute conviction that it does. We don't know. We think that it does. And I think that's fine. Well, go a little deeper in that. So physiologically, what...

00:27:38.432 --> 00:27:54.112
What limits strength and what limits like let's say FTP to you guys? And so now we then we can like look at, okay, how do these overlap? And you want to talk about limiters for strength? Yeah, I think the biggest

00:27:54.112 --> 00:28:13.904
Limiting factor in strength as it pertains to training for sports, right? There's powerlifting and Olympic lifters that are just strong men and women. You can't deny that, right? Their numbers on the platform are undeniably strong, right? Most of them cannot go out and ride a bike for 75 miles. Obviously, we all know that, right? So then the idea is trying to find the balance between

00:28:13.904 --> 00:28:36.368
Strength and mobility, muscular endurance, and keeping our body in alignment and moving properly. So the example I was giving to weight room is if you're, like RJ said, a good squatter, could squat a 300-pound barbell, now your next decision is do I become a 350-pound squatter or do I take my time and effort and energy in putting me in a 300-pound squatter that has great hip, knee, and ankle mobility, great posture.

00:28:36.368 --> 00:29:05.648
Great soft tissue functionality throughout my body. I think that's kind of where we are with the level of person we have to look for. Most of our readers are, I don't want to offend anyone, but let's say weaker in the weight room than guys that lift a lot, right? So the idea is can we get a baseline strength of, dude, get good at a couple of exercises, pick and choose the other auxiliary exercises you want to use for your sport or your discipline, and then really crush any home with that mobility work, that posture work, that core work, and then

00:29:05.648 --> 00:29:34.864
Helson, Rory Porteous, Rory Porteous, Rory Porteous, Rory Porteous, Rory Porteous, Rory Porteous, Rory Porteous, Rory

00:29:34.864 --> 00:30:00.080
That is something that I really liked about this book actually is the core stuff that you talk about, the mobility stuff, the injury prevention stuff. I thought all that was fantastic. I was reading it and I was like,

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:25.952
I think I can get into this, yeah. Then I started reading the other section and I was like, I have some questions. And that's fine. If I can continue on about limiting factors for FTP, limiting factors for strength, genetics, I think Angelo kind of touched on that. And I think there's going to be a genetic limitation for both. And then the amount that you practice.

00:30:25.952 --> 00:30:55.568
Practice makes perfect Time in the saddle Time in the saddle is going to make you a stronger rider We know that You do your workouts You hit your pacing goals You're going to get stronger on the bike You're going to bump your FTP You start to train more frequently in the weight room You lift more frequently in the weight room Obviously you're going to

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:01.440
Wake up any of those neural pathways, right? So you might start to...

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:31.072
Wake up some new motor units that haven't been recruited previously. Now you're going to start to recruit other muscle fibers to help you get stronger. So with both of these, a lot of it, everything comes down to how much time are you spending doing it? And then we all are going to have that governor, which ends up being our genetic component.

00:31:31.072 --> 00:31:55.184
Actually, this brings me to something else and then we'll circle back around because one of the things that I noticed in the very back of the book is your loading schemes for like cyclist peak mileage template. When I'm reading this, I'm like, okay, so you start with soft tissue mobility stuff.

00:31:55.184 --> 00:32:23.376
Foundation Superset, Superset 2, Lower Body, Upper Body. I'm like, yeah, this is great, et cetera, et cetera. But the loading scheme, I don't see anything on the loading scheme and you really didn't touch on it in the book. Like I really didn't feel like that was elucidated very well. And so why don't you take this time for – because if somebody does get this book and read it, they're going to be like, how much do I lift? Because it's like three sets of 10, four sets of eight and stuff like that. So what's –

00:32:23.376 --> 00:32:36.480
What should be people doing in the weight room? And then we'll kind of circle back around to this thing. We kind of look at it as if you're new to strength training, you're an intermediate level strength training, if we're doing a set of 10.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:33:05.840
Pick a weight where reps 8, 9, and 10 are pretty challenging, right? If you're blowing through the sets and you're ready to go immediately when you're done, there's not enough resistance to really get any kind of strength or hypertrophy effect from that set. If you're getting crushed to rep 7 and you're just grinding out reps 8 and 9 and you need a spotter for rep number 10, that's obviously too heavy for what we're trying to accomplish with this population, right? So we kind of left it a little bit open-ended to make the end of every set challenging, right? And when you're getting 10 reps cleanly, then progress to the next weight on the set.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:35.056
The Bar, The Machine, The Kettlebell, whatever you're using, right? We also left it open enough to realize during certain times of the year, you have to manipulate your intensity enough for what you're trying to accomplish, right? So if it's my off-season and I got a heavy, you know, goblet squat day and pick up some heavy dumbbells and I'm from shore the next day, not a big deal. If I'm in the middle of my building a base and running a ton of miles for me and my next morning I'm going on a 15-mile run, which might be a lot for me, maybe I got to go a little bit lighter on the dumbbell goblet squats and not crush my quads.

00:33:35.056 --> 00:34:04.272
I don't want to be sore the next day. We're trying to give you a recipe, but maybe not a formula where every single number and intensity is spelled out for you because in reality, it's really hard to do that for hopefully a lot of people reading the book and we don't know all of them personally. Whereas if I was working with a client individually, I might not get a one rep max for an endurance person, but I would estimate some maxes, start bouncing some of the big exercises off percentage of that one rep max and have suggestions every day of where to start your sets and

00:34:04.272 --> 00:34:24.752
Intensity-wise, with a book going out to this many people, it's really hard to do that. A lot of the loading recommendations and auto-regulation kind of stuff was in the text of the book. I think a lot of people are just going to flip right to the back with the schemes and go, hey, wait a minute. It's like giving a list of the ingredients but not how much.

00:34:24.752 --> 00:34:46.255
for a recipe. I was like, so this is actually going to make people go read this book. If that was an intentional decision, I think it was an interesting one. It's something that I might have done myself if I were writing a book. Well, I think it's really hard though because it's hard to actually pick what the loading scheme is going to be given that we don't know where everyone's starting.

00:34:46.255 --> 00:35:15.472
Could we sit there and say, hey, you know, we want everybody to do a 10 repetition max and then use the chart and then figure out what, you know, what your one RM is and then, you know, go from there? I think it would have been a bit much if we were to try to have people doing that. So, yeah, I mean, it's hard. And, you know, maybe did we take that for granted? I don't know. I mean.

00:35:15.472 --> 00:35:34.912
I was hoping for an RPE scheme at least. This time of year, you can go to an 8 or a 9. This time of year, you should only go to a 5 or a 6. It's interesting that you talk about that because I'm actually on a dissertation committee right now where the gentleman is working on...

00:35:34.912 --> 00:36:02.656
he's working with power lifters and he's doing velocity based training so and then versus RPE and so he's doing a comparison between between both of those schemes as to you know how should we you know determine you know rep range and things like that based off of those so we tried to keep it relatively simple I think if you notice in in the in the schemes you know you'd see that

00:36:02.656 --> 00:36:24.432
We knock down the rep ranges in the taper phase, clearly because we want somebody to just be doing a little bit lighter weight and less reps. That way they're getting a little bit less volume. Yeah, of course, if somebody's maintaining the same RPE, then it's going to be like, oh, even heavier. Cool.

00:36:24.432 --> 00:36:54.432
So I unfortunately could see it backfiring because I'm sure you guys know a lot of the same types of athletes I know where you write something like this and you try to impart all the nuance that you can and then somebody goes, all right, what's the best way I can meet head my way through this with the heaviest weights possible because more gains are more better, right? Yeah, that's always a concern. Yeah. Oh, sorry, Angelo. It looked like you had a thought right there.

00:36:54.432 --> 00:37:14.928
Okay, cool. No, I'm fine. You guys are great. So lifting and season. Let's talk about some overlap of things. Like how do you recommend people add strength training to their week or to their day if they're going to like do a double? Yeah. So go ahead. Okay.

00:37:15.792 --> 00:37:41.136
No, we just kind of realized early on an endurance athlete, too much fatigue and too little time, right? So we try to keep the workouts about 40-45 minutes max, recommending at least two times a week, as many as three and four depending on what their schedule works out to, right? I think in a perfect world, people will be able to, if they're doing two a day, be able to do their endurance work earlier in the morning, come back and do the gym, mobility stuff later in the afternoon, right? Realize that's not...

00:37:41.136 --> 00:37:48.896
possible for just about everybody. I think in general, and that's my opinion as a training and conditioning coach, you got to take whatever is the most important thing you're doing that day.

00:37:48.896 --> 00:38:18.192
And do it first when your body's fresh, your central nervous system is activated, you're not pre-fatigued from anything else, right? So the overall majority of people reading this book during most of their year, we're going to say prioritize your endurance training, which in this case is cycling, right? And then find ways to plug in these 40-minute workouts around that. Now, if you know you're struggling with your strength and you need to get stronger and you have some things you want to correct on your body, maybe in your off-season you prioritize the strength training, right? And work in your endurance training or you're maybe doing...

00:38:18.192 --> 00:38:46.144
Cross Training or something like that will often be in path for you and do that in your second session or after your lifting every day. But for most of our readers and most of the time of their year, we're going to recommend, obviously, focus on your cycling and plug the endurance workouts around that. What's the concurrent training effect a consideration in your programming recommendations? What do you mean a concurrent training effect? Oh, like the Hickson study from the first time that anybody had somebody had...

00:38:46.144 --> 00:39:15.248
Athletes do both endurance and strength training. And then after seven weeks, the strength training started to taper off. People actually started to lose after concurrently gaining. And so after a couple of weeks, basically what happens is the molecular pathways between endurance and strength training start to interfere in favor of endurance training. So is that something that you had consideration with the recommendations? I got to tell you, we did not.

00:39:15.248 --> 00:39:39.168
This is why we come and do these things. We're learning. I was unfamiliar with the Hickson study, so I appreciate what you're mentioning there. Look, one of the things that people do talk about is you've got an anaerobic sport and the person's training for an aerobic sport. So somehow they're going to kind of like...

00:39:39.168 --> 00:40:08.992
interfere with one another. And is it going to wipe out the effect that you're looking for? And, you know, it's one of those, it's a catch-22 because you're sitting there going, you know, if I don't do the strength training, you know, what's that going to do for my overall body alignment? And again, I think this is probably going to be a little bit more important for our folks that are, you know, triathletes that are having to then go run after they're getting off the bike.

00:40:08.992 --> 00:40:37.840
As I said, you know, maybe not as important for a cyclist while they're in season. But yeah, it's totally a catch-22 of, you know, what do you do? And are you actually, you know, having a harmful effect on your other part of the training? So I don't know the answer to that, to be honest with you. There's scientific studies, as you pointed out. But again,

00:40:37.968 --> 00:41:02.848
That's one study. Yeah, well I mean tens or hundreds of other studies have pretty much found the same thing later and elucidating the molecular mechanisms is something that continues to this day. But we do know enough at this point to at least be able to make some recommendations and your recommendation of doing endurance first actually tracks pretty well.

00:41:02.848 --> 00:41:32.112
And, um, but I do find sometimes when I have people doing heavy strength training, even if they're like, you know, even professional athletes who have all day to, you know, eat and recover and sleep and all that. Um, you know, sometimes that we'll find that their, uh, their endurance improvements just aren't happening anymore, especially if they're super keen to get into the weight room and, you know, not lose their, you know, not lose the strength in season. But it's like, at some point it's like, you know, we should have seen some more movement in your aerobic metrics right now when we're not.

00:41:32.112 --> 00:41:47.920
So we might have to think about seriously cutting down the weights or just cutting it out entirely. But that's an intensity thing that we kind of talked about before. Yeah. And what you're kind of even bringing up there is listening to your athlete. And one thing that we kind of always say is...

00:41:47.920 --> 00:42:16.512
Coaching is an art and a science, right? So there's a science that says it should be one way and you're expecting that you're going to be getting this effect on this athlete and then you're just not seeing it. You need to listen to them, adjust it, and then go from there. So that's just part of good coaching. Yeah, because I don't think I saw that in the book or I didn't see it as explicitly as I thought I would.

00:42:16.512 --> 00:42:44.368
and I was like okay yeah these I think I really am getting a handle on their target audience here as you as you've mentioned so what would you what would you recommend for like serious endurance cyclists because that's that's pretty much who listens to this podcast so what would your recommendation be in terms of auto regulation with you know weights like intensity like if you're trying to do an FTP workout later in the week and you can't hit your numbers and you're suspecting it's your it's the weight stuff how would you recommend people adjust

00:42:44.368 --> 00:43:09.056
either the timing of the weight training and the endurance training or even the loading schemes. Yeah, I mean, I'm going to have somebody do any of their aerobic training in the morning. I think that should be the first priority of the day. And then I don't have it in front of me, but...

00:43:09.056 --> 00:43:30.848
Anytime that you're working out and hitting zone 4, zone 5 at higher efforts, we know that there's going to be a longer period that it's going to take for recovery. I want to say it's like a two-day... I can't think of exactly...

00:43:30.848 --> 00:43:53.760
I believe that it's usually about two days to recover after a zone five. So I think you're really going to need to take into consideration how hard the work is and know what your recovery should be. So perhaps I'm not going to be, if I did that, you know, super hard, you know, FTP workout.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:44:14.384
I might be not lifting for another couple days or I might actually have at least two days prior to that so that I'm actually not I will be recovered and be ready for it. Yeah. Have you found that the the endurance training also affects you in the gym when you're especially if you're trying to lift a little heavier?

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:32.080
Yeah, definitely. Just general overall fatigue. If you're going in a gym at 7 o'clock in the morning, fully rested, fully hydrated, fully recovered from whatever you did the day before, you're going to lift heavier weights than if you're coming off a...

00:44:32.080 --> 00:45:01.552
25 mile bike ride over hills and that kind of stuff dealing with the elements that even if it was the day before we're going to recover somewhat overnight if you took care of business and slept enough, ate enough, drank enough but I think to some extent it's almost unavoidable that eventually if you're training properly your endurance training is going to I don't want to say negatively affect what you're doing in the weight room but it will have an effect right so then you got to kind of not let ego take over and say I always have to lift at least these weights when some days these weights might not be

00:45:01.552 --> 00:45:30.768
B, what your body is able to handle that day, right? I think as endurance athletes, as long as you keep the focus on your endurance training and realize the weight room is to supplement that, not take away from it, and keep in mind what's important, you can do that properly, you know what I mean? I think that's a little bit more the art than the science of it. Now, one thing we already, you know, the National Student Edition Association is big on percentages, right? You get a one rep max, you lift on a percentage of that. The problem with that with endurance athletes, and really all I see, if you want to keep it 100% real, is let's say on the day you test,

00:45:30.768 --> 00:45:59.984
We'll use a back squat in the example. You squat 100 pounds. That's all you had that day. That's 100% effort, one rep max. You get 100 pound squat max, right? Well, then coming the next week and you didn't sleep, you're dehydrated, you were up late for whatever reason and you went on a long run the day before. Well, now 80 pounds might be 100% of your max for what you have in tank that day, right? On the other token, if we're training getting stronger a couple weeks later, 100 pounds might only really be 80% of your max. So as much as I think having someone

00:45:59.984 --> 00:46:29.200
idea of your maxes and a vague idea of where you should plug your weights in the lift. I think for this population, going by something like rate of perceived exertion or kind of just feel, for lack of a scientific term, might be a better option because we're acknowledging what you're doing on the bike is more important than what you're doing in the weight room, but you got to be smart and not let your ego take over of I need to always put 45s on the ball. I always need at least a 50-pound kettlebell because that could be a recipe for disaster depending on the time of year.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:57.248
I think what you said before about being supplemental is super important that I think a lot of folks don't appreciate that I do think you guys emphasize properly in the book that your main sport is not being a powerlifter. It's not getting in there to do whatever. Okay, so I want to read one sentence from the book that I hope your publishers made you put in because this is the only thing that really made me pop an eyebrow.

00:46:57.248 --> 00:47:24.560
I was like, you guys better be bringing your A game to the podcast. Okay, so where is it? The improved strength will bump up your FTP, which in turn means you can ride at a higher percentage of FTP for your Ironman or other distance events. Basically, you spend chapter 14, page 145. That page basically says, you get stronger, your FTP is going to go up.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:52.880
fairly certain terms. Yeah. And, you know, look, probably written for a little bit more of a general audience than your folks. And the idea is if you actually put some effort, build a little bit more, you know, skeletal muscle, you should be stronger. Hopefully, you're pushing more, you know, you're pushing more power to the pedal as you do that.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:48:21.968
Yeah, I mean, when you're dealing with the editors, sometimes they're like, we need this to be a stronger statement. And, you know, I believe we even had that as like, you know, it should. A little more equivocal. And, you know, I think we might have had it so it was like, well, it should do this. Yeah, proper scientific writing. Yeah, it may, it might, it could. And that's what I'm used to, you know, for submitting something in terms of scientific manuscript.

00:48:21.968 --> 00:48:51.840
Yeah, they want a little bit more gusto and a little bit more, you know, so, look, things get edited, and do we mean that? No, but I think, you know, just kind of letting you know that, yeah, sometimes, and this is part of the process of writing the book, too. Could we have pushed back? We could have, at the same point in time.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:49:20.624
Is it something that is, you know, does that hurt the book entirely? I don't know. You tell me. I don't necessarily think so, but, you know, it's maybe because I am as much of a nerd as I am that actually made me think very deeply about something, which is that way early in the podcast, what was it, like Wallstock number nine or something like that? I think it was like Strength Endurance and the Science Principle. What we looked at was a study on

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:44.320
strength training and power output and VO2 max on the bike. And I think they did like a 20 minute time trial or something like that. Power output went up. VO2 max did not go up after strength training. And it was pretty much like you were talking about before, recruiting more motor units. And that was my explanation anyway. It was not the explanation given in the paper, but...

00:49:44.320 --> 00:50:11.536
That was mine. And I'm sure you guys are familiar with the 20 minute FTP test that is still fairly ubiquitous in terms of, you know, setting bike training zones. And I think, and that's what it made me think of is, you know, and a lot of other training programs, you know, for competitive cyclists are like this, where they'll teach to the test as it were, where they'll give you like

00:50:11.856 --> 00:50:39.200
training that improves your anaerobic capacity and so you can crush this FTP test that's actually well over FTP. That's what that made me think of. I was like, you know what? Technically, if you're going to define FTP as 95% of your 20-minute power, this might actually be right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's funny that you're mentioning that FTP because I always remember

00:50:39.200 --> 00:51:05.200
I know I've read your paper on TrainingPeaks or whatever, your blog on TrainingPeaks of your disdain. Believe me, there's very little editing in that. So if it was bad, it was. Of your disdain for the ramp tests and the overestimation in FTP for it. And, you know, I agree with you. I find that it does overestimate.

00:51:05.552 --> 00:51:32.384
Well, especially because you do strength training. I do strength training. Even before I did strength training, I always had a really good interoper capacity just naturally. It's funny. It's like since I quit endurance training or focusing on it really years ago in favor of track sprinting, I have done so much weightlifting and so little endurance training. I can tell you for a certainty, just weightlifting does not improve your FTP.

00:51:32.384 --> 00:52:01.952
I can imagine. It's very, very bad these days. I can imagine. Yeah. I mean, well, as we already talked about, limiting factors, right? And this goes back to, you know, practice in your sport, right? So time in the saddle, if you're looking to bump your FTP, time in the weight room, if you're looking to, you know, improve your squat. Yeah. All right. So I have one more thing I want to ask you guys, which is about core training and injury prevention.

00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:20.752
Go into it in the book and it's not nearly anything that I could even pretend to be even a dilettante in. And so why don't you give folks some recommendations for what they can do in like 20 or 30 minutes to help, you know.

00:52:20.752 --> 00:52:47.104
Stability on the bike to help prevent, you know, kinetic leak and to help injury prevention, you know, especially like shoulders and, you know, small stabilizing muscles and stuff like that because everybody knows all the squat stuff like, you know, you do your big heavy weights first and all that kind of stuff is pretty, you know, we've got it pretty well in the podcast and everyone else does too. But I think this is something that doesn't really get enough attention sometimes. Yeah. And this was we we felt that this was something that maybe.

00:52:47.104 --> 00:53:16.720
set our book aside from some of the others that are out there as well. And one of the concepts that we really wanted to introduce to everyone was the idea of anti-rotation. And anti-rotation essentially just means the constant rotations that we're having between the trunk and the pelvis. And so by doing an anti-rotation exercise, that will actually help to stabilize all of the

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:36.576
the much smaller muscles around the area. And so, for instance, things that are okay to continue to do, it's fine if people want to plank, it's fine if people want to still do their crunches, but that's just not the way that the body's working.

00:53:36.576 --> 00:54:06.272
and so we wanted it to be a little bit more sports specific and so since as we're riding we're constantly having the pelvic drop and hip hike that would happen and we're hoping to minimize that and so we introduced a lot of anti-rotation exercises throughout the book

00:54:06.272 --> 00:54:25.104
for whichever sport whether it was the the swim the bike or the run a lot of the exercises will help to recruit those smaller stabilizing muscles and almost prevent or limit the amount of rotation and when we do that

00:54:25.104 --> 00:54:44.336
We do create a much stronger core. So rather than just doing these exercises that are uniplanar, pardon me, such as a crunch that's only working us in the sagittal plane, a lot of these are resisting the rotations.

00:54:44.336 --> 00:55:10.192
or some of the motion in the frontal plane such as the hip hike and hip drop. So, Angie, you want to talk about some of the different exercises? Sure. So we put a lot of our main anti-rotation exercises are ones we're kind of battling to stay centered and not going with the body naturally to rotate.

00:55:10.192 --> 00:55:20.960
towards or away from the anchor point of say a band or a plate or something we're dragging across our body or across the floor for the exact same reasons RJ said because you have to fight that resistance or you have to

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:50.288
Fight that rotational urge when you're on a bike, right? When you're in the saddle or on the seat. So we kind of put it together where every workout has an anti-rotation exercise in it, right? We give you about a dozen probably choices between them and some ways of progress and regress, each one depending on where you are in the program, right? And we really kind of hammered that point home because we think if you've been training for any length of time, you know your planks, you know your sit-ups, your crunches, your leg raise, the stuff you're already probably doing, this anti-rotation piece might be something brand new.

00:55:50.288 --> 00:55:53.680
something a lot of even pretty experienced cyclists can probably get a lot out of.

00:55:53.680 --> 00:56:22.960
So we might start with some super basic, you know, hold the plank, tap your shoulder, try not to rotate away from the hand that's planted, right? And if we get good at that, we can progress that to a plate drag across the ground. If we get good at that, we can put a light resistance band on a rack and use that as a raise or lower our arm and kind of stay in that good, neutral push-up position. We can do that movement standing, we can do it in a plank, in a push-up. There's a bunch of different ways we can do it that we outline in the book. Just the idea that that's probably the one thing that even people that are pretty

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:47.216
experience at training might be leaving out of the training, right? So we try to give you a bunch of choices, a bunch of options, and a bunch of different ways to fire those anti-rotation mechanisms in your body that hopefully transfer out onto the bike. Yeah, so what would be your top three anti-rotation exercises? Because you just mentioned the variations on the plank, so how would you do one of these?

00:56:50.672 --> 00:57:09.040
I'll go first. I think a great place to start if you haven't done much of this kind of training, get that little push-up position. Start with your stance a little wider, right? So you got a little bit wider base before you're going through with your feet together like a regular push-up. Keep your left hand planted on the ground, elbows fully extended. Take your right hand off the ground.

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:38.320
Tap your shoulder, put it back on the ground, slow and controlled, repeat on the other side for the specified number of reps you want to do today. And keep on, even if you're great at doing push-ups, your first day doing this is probably not going to look like you're great at doing push-ups, right? Because the first thing that's going to happen is you're going to lift your right hand up, your whole body is going to naturally rotate to your left side, which is where the stable base is, right? Can we do that enough times and get good enough at it, strong enough, where we can stay in a push-up position and look like we're doing a push-up and just raise one?

00:57:38.320 --> 00:58:06.896
Yeah, I agree.

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:32.032
Yeah, most of this anti-rotation stuff is much harder than it looks and even makes pre-experienced lifters look foolish a lot of times, which can be funny to watch. But once you get it, it gets easier like any other exercise. But when you go, you'll see a difference in right away. I think one of the things that we constantly remind in any of those exercises is you're going to need less weight than you really think.

00:58:32.032 --> 00:58:48.016
As you said, these are really challenging. And so if I'm going to do an around the world where I'm just, you know, standing in a shoulder width apart stance with a plate and then bringing that up and around my head and then back.

00:58:48.016 --> 00:59:13.616
A 45 pound plate is quite a bit and people need to remember that the goal is to really limit the amount of motion that you're actually having there as you're doing it. That exercise is a funny one because I think everyone always initially thinks, oh this has got to be for my upper body and it's like, no this is completely for your core here as you're going to be

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:40.112
bringing this plate around your head in each way. As Angelo said, we've got all the different progressions and regressions in the book. You can definitely move from a shoulder-width part stance into a half-kneel stance and then do that. That's one of my go-to exercises, I have to say, at the gym.

00:59:42.960 --> 01:00:12.768
I'm going to give the listeners one quick heads up on this I think will be valuable if you could get a training partner or a coach to watch you do these at first and tell you how you're doing it and if that's not possible get your phone out videotape a sec and then look at it back because even people with good kinesthetic awareness tend to struggle and think they look one way on these exercises and look a drastically different way and you just can't tell right you say you're doing it yourself you can't really tell what you look like but that second set of eyes or using the camera on your phone is a great place to start

01:00:12.768 --> 01:00:36.672
And then maybe check out your form in between sets and look at I have to drop this hip in this direction or whatever it might be. But it's really hard to tell if you're doing that right by yourself. That's something that I always have my athletes do is like if they're doing squats or something like that, like when they start out every year, like record the first couple sets in video and just send it to me. I'll watch them and I'll be able to give you cues. But, you know.

01:00:36.672 --> 01:01:00.432
Get somebody there in person to help is preferable. And hopefully not somebody who's going to give you, you know, 300 cues between every rep. Right. Right. Try to find something that like, you know, gets the person to, you know, to move everything else in the right way, too.

01:01:00.464 --> 01:01:18.272
It is definitely challenging to do that though. You guys also recommend the Renegade Row and as soon as I saw that I was like, yeah, Renegade Row, let's go. That's absolutely one of my favorite supplementary exercises for cyclists. I think it's a favorite for cyclists and it's funny with –

01:01:18.272 --> 01:01:47.600
putting together a top 10 list and dealing with publishers. They're like, yeah, there's got to be, you know, the top 10. I was like, well, there's probably a top 15 or a top 20, you know, if we were really doing this. But yeah, we love that because it really does build, it causes you to really build a lot of stability through the side that you're actually not lifting. So from the, if I was lifting the dumbbell up,

01:01:47.600 --> 01:02:16.576
on my right side, really having to provide a lot of support on that backside of the left hand and the right foot. So that'll really create a lot of stability for me with that. And one of the things that we discussed through the book as we were talking about the importance with a lot of our anti-rotation exercises is there's these

01:02:16.576 --> 01:02:45.440
There's these X kinetic chains that crisscross through the pelvis and the trunk. And if we fail to strengthen those full kinetic chains, then we're not going to be able to provide as much stability through the core as we're trying to do. So really great core exercise with, I would say, posterior kinetic chain.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:03:12.832
You know, you're getting the benefit for the shoulders with the row. Yeah. I have one kind of concluding thought here because I think you guys mentioned early in the book somewhere about different exercise traditions, like strength training traditions, you know, basically like bodybuilding, powerlifting and Olympic lifting and how.

01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:42.368
That kind of has a lot of influence on people and then we can pick and choose the pieces of those traditions that we want. So just generally in terms of endurance training culture, how much of that kind of stuff do you still see going on as people being like, oh, you got to do sets of like 15 to 20 or even like overemphasizing certain exercises like

01:03:42.368 --> 01:04:10.560
in different ways. Like, oh yeah, you got to, if you're doing leg press, you got to do it just like you're riding a bike. You know, you got to do sets of 200. So how much of that do you see? And, you know, how much of that, and how much of like what you guys are talking about do you think is changing where people go, oh, there's actually something else, something else better we can do? Okay. I think in a positive way, those three disciplines influence everything we do in the fitness industry in this respect, right?

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:14.816
We're talking about cycling specifically. If we're dealing with a client who is...

01:04:14.816 --> 01:04:44.112
very thin, almost no muscle mass, and needs to just get stronger and bigger. We're going to steal some bodybuilding principles to establish some muscle mass on that man or woman. Fair enough. At the same point, the idea that not powerlifter level, but being good at a squat, some kind of bench press, and some kind of deadlift, I think is a great foundation for just about everybody. So we're going to steal from powerlifting for that, right? As far as the power we develop in Olympic weightlifting, now let's be real. We don't need to be doing

01:04:44.112 --> 01:05:13.328
Snatches and Cleans from the Floor and Heavy Push Jerks with people that are riding a bike 100 miles at a time. But at some points in the year, can we pick and choose a couple of those movements, a couple of those exercises that stimulate the triple extension of the knee, the hip, and the ankle the way a power cleaner snatch start of the platform would and implement some of that? I think we can. So in a positive way, we can definitely use some of the principles of bodybuilding, powerlifting, and Olympic weightlifting while we're training endurance athletes, but obviously tweak them to fit the

01:05:13.328 --> 01:05:26.064
As somebody who's been doing this since the mid-90s, back in the 90s, every weight room in the country had a record board and everybody was trying to be as strong as everybody else and everybody had to max out their squat clean.

01:05:26.064 --> 01:05:55.344
Push Jerk, whatever it was. And then I think in the 2000s, we kind of saw it go completely the other way of everything had to be quote unquote functional, right? It didn't matter how much you could squat, it was more important to do a single leg squat and a half BOSU ball while holding a kettlebell overhead with one arm, right? I think where we are now, and I think we're in a better spot is we realize it's got to be someplace in the middle, right? We got to get good at the foundation exercises, establish good motor patterns and good central nervous system firing to do your basic stuff.

01:05:55.344 --> 01:06:24.560
Squat, the lunge, upper body push, upper body pull, and then while we get strong at that, let's stay flexible, let's stay mobile, and get good at the other stuff that we know is important as well, like our posture, our balance, our proprioception. I think you've got to kind of pick and choose. I think the biggest change is it went from everybody's got to lift super heavy all the time with the basic stuff to that's the old way, adequate way of thinking, let's do everything super quote unquote functional, and now I think we realize as a profession the answer is probably so

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:48.272
What's the weirdest functional exercise you've ever seen, both of you? I need to know. Don't name names, because I think we all know who we're thinking of, but just what is the exercise that's the oddest? Oh, God. I'm going to go trying to stand on a full physio ball.

01:06:48.272 --> 01:07:13.408
and doing a squat and some kind of resistance across your shoulders. I've seen people attempt that before. Number one, it can end really bad depending on how you land on the floor when you fall off of that. And number two, I think I can kind of see why that might be valuable, but the implementation of it is just so dangerous, right? Could you do it on an Eriks pad or a Bosu ball or something like that and get a similar effect?

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:36.544
Yeah, and have a much lower chance of ending up in the emergency room than you're doing on a full physio ball. RJ, what do you got? Top of my head, that's what I got. You're just so dangerous. I guess I hang out in gyms that people aren't taking those crazy risks because I would say I've seen something very similar but more on a BOSU ball.

01:07:36.544 --> 01:08:03.264
The minute that you're doing single leg on a BOSU ball and then trying to do an overhead press of some kind, yeah, it's a little ridiculous. Not needed. What were you thinking of when you asked the question? Because you looked like you saw some crazy stuff. God, I don't even know. The one that I always think of...

01:08:03.264 --> 01:08:32.352
first is a track sprinter who's got like 225 and he's doing single leg squats on a BOSU. And I was like, I get it, but I only think I get it. Yeah, I mean, the risk of injury, geez, that's just nuts. Yeah, I mean, because I think part of it is like it comes from

01:08:32.352 --> 01:08:56.287
Right.

01:08:56.287 --> 01:09:11.631
I think we always say we live in an amazing time with the amount of information that's available on ways to train for anybody, right? The stuff that's out there, it's amazing. More of the time than any other time recorded human history. But the bad part of that is people that don't understand.

01:09:11.631 --> 01:09:32.112
The context of how to implement these things are trying to implement them in ways they really shouldn't be, right? So for example, what we're talking about now, doing a squat on an unstable surface probably has a value during certain times of year for certain people, but doing it loaded up with a bar with 245s on each side on a physio ball, there's a bunch of things that go wrong there, you're probably way more risk.

01:09:32.112 --> 01:09:45.520
That reward in that case, right? What I always do with the Australian District Coaches, people come to me and say, I read this is what Saquon Barkley does every day to train and play for the New York Giants. I want to make my 8-year-old do the same workout for Pop Warner Football.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:10:14.128
Alright, so do you guys have any other final thoughts before we close this out?

01:10:17.104 --> 01:10:45.792
No, man, I just want to say thanks for checking out the book. Thanks for reading it so thoroughly. I really appreciate that. It gave us a lot of good ideas to improve and put the sequel out in hopefully 2023 or 2024. And thanks for the questions, man. I really appreciate your time. I was excited when you said, I think I might have some differences compared to what you guys are thinking. I was like, oh, that's going to actually make for a more rich discussion and make me think.

01:10:45.792 --> 01:11:15.616
I like that. So thank you for having us. This was fun. Yeah, sure. And your book made me think quite a lot too, guys. Yeah, really appreciate you reaching out to me and sending me the book. And it's going to live on my bookshelf. It's not like the Lance Armstrong training book where I was like, oh, yeah, this has to go into the fiction shelf. Well, you know, hopefully you use books the way that I do.

01:11:15.616 --> 01:11:32.992
I don't sit there and hang on a book for every little last detail. A lot of times I'm just like, what kind of a nugget did I take away from this? And so hopefully we gave you some nuggets to think about and incorporate with some of your athletes.

01:11:32.992 --> 01:11:53.376
We've talked about some of the philosophical differences that we have, which is cool, but maybe you get something out of it in terms of Oh yeah, I will definitely be reaching into there for the mobility stuff and the core stuff most definitely Cool, awesome For sure Alright, thanks guys Thank you very much

01:11:53.376 --> 01:12:18.384
