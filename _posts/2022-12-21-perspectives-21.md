# Cycling Performance Masterclass: A Deep Dive

This document provides a detailed analysis of the advanced concepts in cycling training, strategy, and physiology as discussed in the Empirical Cycling Podcast featuring host Coleen Moore and elite cyclist Cory Lockwood. It's structured for an audience that appreciates both the scientific underpinnings and the practical application of high-performance principles.

## 1. The Physiology of Altitude and Performance

A central theme of the discussion is Cory's 40km time trial record set in Moriarty, New Mexico, at an elevation of approximately 6,500 feet. This highlights the critical role of altitude in endurance sports.

### a. Why Altitude Matters: The Science

-   **Reduced Air Density:** At higher altitudes, the air is less dense. This is the primary reason athletes seek altitude for speed records. It results in significantly lower aerodynamic drag, meaning a cyclist can travel faster for the same power output.
    
-   **Reduced Partial Pressure of Oxygen (**PO2​**):** While the _percentage_ of oxygen in the air remains ~21%, the lower atmospheric pressure at altitude means there are fewer air molecules (including oxygen) in any given volume of air. This reduced partial pressure makes it harder for oxygen to move from the lungs into the bloodstream.
    
-   **The Physiological Challenge:** This oxygen deficit, known as **hypoxia**, directly limits aerobic metabolism. The body's ability to produce energy via the aerobic system is compromised, leading to a lower maximal oxygen uptake (VO2​max) and a lower functional threshold power (FTP).
    

### b. Acclimatization: The Body's Response

The podcast highlights a fascinating aspect of altitude physiology: **individual variability**.

-   **"Received Wisdom":** The common understanding is that athletes often feel good on day one, feel progressively worse ("flat") through days 3-5, and then begin to adapt. This "flat" period is often associated with an immune response and fluid shifts as the body begins the adaptation process.
    
-   **Cory's Experience:** Cory notes that with his extensive background living and training at moderate altitudes (4,000-6,000 ft), he adapts relatively quickly, feeling good within about 6-7 days.
    
-   **Key Takeaway:** This underscores that while scientific literature provides averages, an individual's history and genetics create a unique response profile. Experience (`N=1` data) is invaluable. As the podcast notes, "it doesn't make your experience wrong. It means that you are just not one of the average people from one of those studies."
    

### c. Altitude, VO2​max, and Performance

There's a distinction made between moderate (5,000-7,000 ft) and high (8,000+ ft) altitudes.

-   Athletes with a high VO2​max (like Cory) often tolerate moderate altitudes better. Their highly developed aerobic systems are more efficient at oxygen transport and utilization, mitigating some of the initial performance decrement.
    
-   However, at higher altitudes, the oxygen deficit becomes so significant that even elite physiology is heavily impacted, requiring more dedicated acclimatization.
    

## 2. Time Trial Strategy: The Art of Pacing

The discussion reveals that even a seemingly simple "out-and-back" course is a complex strategic puzzle.

### a. Macro Strategy: Pacing and Conditions

-   **Negative Splitting:** The ideal strategy is often to ride the second half of an effort faster than the first. On the day of his record, Cory faced a slight headwind/crosswind on the way out and a tailwind on the way back. This allowed him to pace the first half conservatively (relative to the conditions) and ride a significantly faster second half, resulting in a **negative split**.
    
-   **The Failed Attempt:** On the previous day, a tailwind on the way out created a "losing battle." It forced him to expend too much energy early, leading to a massive power drop on the headwind return leg and causing him to "blow up" before the finish. This is a classic pacing error, baited by deceptively high initial speeds.
    

### b. Micro Strategy: "Attacking the Course"

Cory's background in motocross informs his approach. He breaks the course down into numerous small sections, each with its own strategy.

-   **Terrain Features:** Even minor undulations are treated as technical obstacles and opportunities.
    
    -   **Uphills:** Require careful power modulation to avoid accumulating excessive fatigue. A slight rise can be "deceiving" and bait an over-expenditure of energy.
        
    -   **Crests:** Attacking _over_ the top of a crest carries momentum onto the subsequent flat or downhill.
        
    -   **Downhills:** An opportunity to increase speed with minimal power, often by adopting a more aerodynamic tuck.
        
-   **Line Choice:** Similar to a road racer or motocross rider, Cory uses the entire width of the road to find the smoothest pavement and the most efficient line, minimizing rolling resistance and maximizing speed.
    

## 3. Aerodynamics: The Balance of Power and Position

The podcast demystifies aerodynamics, moving beyond the wind tunnel and into real-world application.

### a. The Power vs. Aero Trade-off

This is one of the most critical concepts in modern time trialing.

-   **The Myth of "Uncomfortable = Fast":** A common mistake is for athletes to adopt an extreme position that looks aerodynamic but is unsustainable. This position often closes the hip angle excessively, restricts breathing, and prevents the rider from producing their maximal power.
    
-   **The Goal:** The optimal position is a balance. It should be the most aerodynamic position in which you can still produce your maximal, sustainable power for the duration of the event. A powerful but less aerodynamic position is often faster than a "super aero" position that costs 50 watts.
    
-   **Core Principle:** Start with a powerful and sustainable position, and then make it aerodynamic. Don't start with a hyper-aerodynamic position and try to force power into it.
    

### b. Real-World Aero Testing

For those without access to a wind tunnel, Cory outlines a systematic, practical approach.

1.  **Establish a Baseline:** Find a consistent, flat stretch of road with minimal traffic.
    
2.  **Control Variables:** Test on days with similar weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind).
    
3.  **Isolate Changes:** Make only **one** small, measurable adjustment at a time (e.g., move spacers, change hand position, try a different helmet). If you change multiple things, you won't know what caused the effect.
    
4.  **Gather Data:** Perform repeated efforts at a constant power output and observe the speed.
    
5.  **Use Perceptual Feedback:** Pay attention to aural and tactile cues.
    
    -   **Wind Noise:** A quieter position often indicates smoother airflow around the helmet.
        
    -   **Pressure:** Feeling where the wind is "tugging" on your suit or body can indicate areas of turbulence.
        
6.  **Iterate:** If the change results in more speed for the same power, keep it. If not, revert to the baseline and try something else. This iterative process is what Cory refers to as the "rate of perceived exertion wind tunnel."
    

## 4. Advanced Training Theory and Periodization

The discussion provides a blueprint for structuring a high-performance training year, contrasting common mistakes with a more effective, periodized approach.

### a. Common Amateur Mistakes

-   **"Muddy Training":** This is a key concept. It describes a state where an athlete is chronically tired but never truly sharp. It's caused by riding endurance miles too hard and not having enough "headroom" to perform high-intensity intervals effectively. The result is being good at "tempo" but never truly increasing FTP or VO2​max.
    
-   **Lack of Rest:** The fear of losing fitness often leads athletes to skip a crucial off-season break. The podcast uses the analogy of a ladder: "You've got to like get down off the ladder, move it to higher ground, and now you can climb it again." The rest period allows the body to dissipate accumulated fatigue and prepare to absorb a new training load.
    
-   **Poor Sequencing:** Randomly mixing training stimuli (e.g., lifting, high intensity, volume) without a logical progression.
    

### b. A Professional Periodization Model

1.  **Transition/Off-Season (Post-Season):**
    
    -   **Goal:** Physical and mental recovery.
        
    -   **Execution:** 1-2 weeks of complete rest off the bike.
        
2.  **General Preparation (Base):**
    
    -   **Goal:** Rebuild aerobic base, build foundational strength, and gradually increase training load.
        
    -   **Execution:**
        
        -   **Phase 1 (Adaptation):** Easy, low-volume riding. Introduction of gym work focusing on mobility and basic lifts (e.g., using Rate of Perceived Exertion - RPE).
            
        -   **Phase 2 (Build):** Gradually increase riding volume. Introduce aerobic intensity (Zone 2, Tempo, Sweet Spot). Gym work transitions to heavier lifting for strength development.
            
3.  **Specific Preparation (Pre-Season):**
    
    -   **Goal:** Sharpen specific physiological systems for racing.
        
    -   **Execution:**
        
        -   VO2​max **Block:** A concentrated block of very high-intensity training (e.g., 3-5 minute intervals at >110% of FTP). The goal is to "raise the ceiling" of aerobic capacity. This is extremely taxing and requires a dedicated focus with significant recovery. For a pro like Cory, this involved 18 sessions in 3 weeks. For an amateur, 1-2 sessions per week is more realistic.
            
        -   **Threshold (TTE) Block:** Following the VO2​max work, the focus shifts to improving **Time to Exhaustion (TTE)** at FTP. This involves progressively longer intervals at threshold (e.g., moving from 4x8min to 3x20min to 2x30min to a continuous 60min effort). This "cements" the gains made from the VO2​max block and builds race-specific endurance.
            
4.  **Competition (In-Season):**
    
    -   **Goal:** Maintain fitness and perform optimally in races.
        
    -   **Execution:**
        
        -   Races become the primary source of high intensity.
            
        -   Training between races consists of recovery, endurance, and **maintenance** workouts (e.g., one threshold/TTE session per week to prevent fitness decay).
            
        -   Costly blocks like VO2​max are generally avoided because the recovery demand is too high to combine with racing. The focus is on using the fitness built in the pre-season, not trying to build new fitness.
            

### c. The Coach-Athlete Relationship

The podcast concludes with a reflection on what makes a good coach.

-   **Empathy:** A coach who has experienced the highs and lows of being an athlete can better relate to and guide their clients.
    
-   **Honesty & Humility:** The willingness to say "I don't know" and to admit when a training approach has failed is crucial for long-term development.
    
-   **Communication:** An athlete needs to learn to articulate feedback beyond "goo goo gaga speak," and a coach needs to listen intently to that feedback.
    
-   **Positive Reinforcement:** Coaching should be about understanding _why_ an athlete fails a workout (it's almost always fatigue) and adjusting, rather than punishing them. The goal is collaboration, not dictatorship.
