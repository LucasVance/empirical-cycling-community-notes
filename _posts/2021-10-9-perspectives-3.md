# A Deep Dive into Modern Criterium Racing: Analysis & Strategy

This document provides a detailed analysis of the concepts discussed in the Empirical Cycling Podcast featuring host Coley Moore and professional cyclists Alex Carmona and Taylor Warren. The discussion centers on their transition from traditional road and stage racing to a full season dedicated to the USA Crits series, offering invaluable insights for any competitive cyclist.

## 1. The Fundamental Shift: Road Racing vs. Criterium Racing

The core theme of the podcast is the significant pivot required when moving from the classic format of road racing to the high-octane environment of criteriums (crits). This shift is not just physical, but also mental and strategic.

### Mentality and Rhythm

-   **Road Racing:** Described as having a **"crescendo."** A road race unfolds over 3-5 hours, allowing for a gradual build-up of intensity. There are lulls, moments to recover in the peloton, and the decisive moments often happen late in the race after hours of attrition.
    
-   **Criterium Racing:** Characterized as **"full on from the gun."** The intensity is immediate and unrelenting. Positioning is critical from the first lap, and there is no time to "let your guard down." The shorter duration compresses the entire strategic and physical battle into a non-stop, high-stakes effort. As Taylor notes, you must "not give an inch to anyone and you have to protect your space."
    

### The "Pecking Order" and Team Dynamics

A major difference at the elite level is the race's tactical structure, which is often dictated by a few dominant teams.

-   **The Old Model ("UHC Blue Train"):** In the past, a dominant team like United Healthcare would control only the final 10-20 laps, setting an impossibly high pace for their sprinter.
    
-   **The New Model ("Legion's Control"):** The podcast highlights a shift in strategy, pioneered by the team L39ION of Los Angeles. They establish control from the very beginning of the race, putting 4-5 riders on the front to hold the speed at a blistering 30+ mph.
    
    -   **Effect:** This makes it nearly impossible for individuals or smaller teams to move up. The race becomes "strung out," neutralizing attacks and forcing other teams to adopt a similar "train" formation to even hold their position.
        
-   **The Pecking Order:** This dynamic creates a clear hierarchy on the course. Teams like Legion, Best Buddies, and ButcherBox fight for the front, while others battle for the subsequent positions, hoping to make a late push. This emphasizes the need for a cohesive, powerful team to compete, not just a strong individual.
    

## 2. The Physical Demands of a Criterium Specialist

While both road and crit racing require elite fitness, the specific physiological and technical demands differ significantly.

### Skill vs. Power

A recurring point is that **skill can often trump raw power**.

-   **Bike Handling & Cornering:** This was cited as the single most important skill. Poor cornering creates gaps, forcing a rider to sprint out of every turn to catch back onâ€”an effect known as the **"accordion effect."** This wastes enormous amounts of energy. A skilled rider who corners smoothly saves energy and can compete with physiologically stronger athletes.
    
-   **Positioning:** The ability to "float" in the top 10-15 wheels is a race-winning skill. A rider in 5th wheel experiences a dramatically smoother and less demanding race than a rider in 60th, who is constantly braking and accelerating.
    

### Physiological Profile

-   **Aerobic Engine (FTP/Threshold):** A strong aerobic base is still the foundation. The sustained high pace of a pro crit is a threshold-level effort, even when sitting in the draft. This endurance prevents a rider from going into the red on every minor acceleration.
    
-   **Anaerobic Repeatability:** This is arguably the most critical component. It's the ability to produce high power (e.g., 500-600+ watts) for short durations, recover quickly, and do it again, lap after lap. This is essential for:
    
    -   Accelerating out of corners.
        
    -   Surviving climbs on hilly courses.
        
    -   Moving up in the field.
        
-   **Maximal Sprint Power:** For flat, fast courses that end in a bunch sprint, a high peak power (e.g., 1500+ watts) is necessary to come around other riders who are already traveling at over 35 mph.
    

## 3. Training & Recovery for a Full Crit Season

Racing every weekend creates a unique set of challenges that reshapes the traditional approach to training.

### The "Reservoir of Fitness"

The consensus is that you cannot build significant fitness mid-season.

-   **Off-Season is Key:** The vast majority of fitness gains (estimated at 80%) are made during the off-season training block.
    
-   **In-Season is for Maintenance:** Once the season begins, the goal shifts to maintaining that fitness "reservoir" while managing the fatigue from racing and travel. Trying to add hard training intervals on top of race weekends is a recipe for burnout.
    

### In-Season Training Structure

-   **Let the Races Be the Intensity:** The crits themselves provide the high-intensity, anaerobic stimulus.
    
-   **Focus on Aerobic & Threshold:** Training between races should consist primarily of lower-intensity endurance miles and some tempo/threshold work to maintain the aerobic engine. This facilitates recovery while preventing a loss of base fitness.
    
-   **Recovery is Paramount:** The emphasis must be on recovery. This includes:
    
    -   **Sleep and Nutrition:** These are the non-negotiable foundations (99%) of recovery.
        
    -   **Mid-Season Breaks:** Intentionally scheduling a week or two off from racing is crucial for both physical and mental regeneration.
        
    -   **Strategic Selection:** Don't do every race. Being selective allows for proper recovery and peak performance at key events.
        

### The Coaching Perspective on Fatigue

-   **Objective Signs:** Depressed heart rate for a given effort, lower power output.
    
-   **Subjective Signs:** These are often the earliest indicators. An athlete reporting "tired legs," a lack of focus, or general malaise is a critical warning sign.
    
-   **Motivation:** A drop in motivation is a major red flag for mental burnout. A motivated athlete can often push through physical fatigue, but an unmotivated athlete will underperform regardless of fitness.
    

## 4. Practical Race-Week & Race-Day Strategy

The podcast offered specific, actionable tips for cyclists.

### Race-Specific Workouts

-   **Anaerobic Capacity/VO2 Max:** A Tabata-style workout. **Example: 40 seconds max effort, 20 seconds rest. Repeat 6 times. Do 2-3 sets with 6 minutes of rest between sets.** This is a potent, short workout to sharpen top-end fitness.
    
-   **Race Simulation:** A threshold-based workout with surges. **Example: A 15-20 minute interval at threshold (FTP) with 15-30 second full-gas sprints or power surges embedded within it.** This simulates the need to accelerate hard and then settle immediately back into a high-paced rhythm.
    

### "Openers": The Pre-Race Tune-Up

"Openers" are short, focused sessions the day or two before a race to "open up the legs."

-   **Purpose:** To prime the neuromuscular system, activate energy pathways, and mentally prepare for the coming effort.
    
-   **Structure:** It often mimics the demands of the race. For a crit, this might include a few high-cadence sprints or short, sharp accelerations.
    
-   **The "Two-Day Opener":** A more modern approach where a light-to-moderate workout is done _two days_ before the race, followed by a very easy, short spin the day immediately before. This can be beneficial for athletes who need more recovery time.
    

### Technical Details: Tires and Cornering

-   **Cornering Practice:** The #1 tip for aspiring crit racers. Practice cornering at high speed (30+ mph) to find the optimal line that allows you to carry the most momentum and continue pedaling. Don't just follow the wheel in front; find the best line for yourself.
    
-   **Tires and Pressure:**
    
    -   **Wider is Better:** The riders found 28mm tires (or 25mm tires on wide rims that measure 28-29mm) to be superior, offering better grip, comfort, and confidence.
        
    -   **Lower Pressure:** Running lower pressures (e.g., 70-80 psi for a ~150 lb rider) improves grip and control, which is critical for high-speed cornering. This is a significant departure from the old-school mentality of pumping tires to their maximum pressure.
