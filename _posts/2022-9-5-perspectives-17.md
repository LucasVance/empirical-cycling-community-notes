# An In-Depth Analysis of Modern Endurance Coaching and Triathlon Training

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive educational breakdown of the core concepts discussed in a podcast interview between Kolie Moore of _Empirical Cycling_ and Mikael Eriksson of _Scientific Triathlon_. The conversation offers a masterclass in the philosophy of modern endurance coaching, the practical application of sports science, and the specific challenges of triathlon training. It is intended for students, athletes, and coaches seeking a deeper understanding beyond surface-level tips, focusing on the principles and critical thinking that underpin elite performance and coaching excellence.

## Part 1: The Philosophy of an Evolving Coach

A central theme of the discussion is that the quality of a coach is defined not by a static set of knowledge, but by their mindset and commitment to evolution.

### The Imperative of Self-Criticism and Lifelong Learning

Both speakers agree that being self-critical is one of the most vital traits for a coach. Stagnation is a significant risk in the profession, and the best coaches constantly question their own methods.

-   **The "Cringe Factor":** Looking back at old training plans and cringing is presented as a positive sign. It indicates growth. Eriksson notes, "You don't even have to go back five years, you have to go back one year and you already start to feel a little bit that 'Oh, I wouldn't do this like that.'" This reflects an ongoing refinement of the nuances of training application.
    
-   **Avoiding Dogma:** The alternative is the coach who "just do[es] the same thing year in, year out." Success can be a trap, leading to the assumption that one's methods are perfected. The speakers contrast this with their own approach, where even after an athlete's victory, the question remains: "What could we have done better?"
    
-   **Biases in Coaching:** Coaching is "bound to be influenced by a lot of potential biases." Critical thinking, which Eriksson laments is not taught more in schools, is the primary tool to combat this. Understanding cognitive biases like **confirmation bias**—the tendency to favor information that confirms pre-existing beliefs—is essential for objective analysis of an athlete's progress and the efficacy of a training plan.
    

### The Coach-Athlete Dynamic

The success of a coaching relationship is not solely dependent on the coach's knowledge or the athlete's talent. It is a partnership that requires a specific chemistry.

-   **The Importance of Fit:** A coach and athlete can fail to "click." Communication styles may be mismatched, leading to misunderstandings and frustration. The speakers acknowledge that parting ways in such a scenario is often best for both parties, freeing them to find a better fit.
    
-   **Defining the Coach's Role:** Eriksson is clear about his coaching style: he is not a motivator in the traditional sense. His role is to provide structure and guidance for intrinsically motivated athletes. He states, "I'm not going to be a good coach for the kind of athlete that needs actual motivation." This highlights the importance of aligning athlete needs with a coach's strengths.
    

## Part 2: Bridging Science and Practice

The conversation delves into how a modern coach consumes, interprets, and applies scientific information.

### The Coach as a Knowledge Synthesizer

Eriksson reveals his primary motivation for starting his podcast was "100%... to talk to people" and learn. This positions the coach as an active synthesizer of knowledge, not a passive consumer.

-   **Evaluating New Trends (The "One-Month Rule"):** With constant exposure to new studies and methods, a coach needs a system to avoid "jumping on some bandwagon." Eriksson's personal rule is to **wait at least a month** after hearing a new, exciting idea. If the idea still holds appeal after that period of reflection, it's worth considering.
    
-   **Organic Integration, Not "Aha!" Moments:** True learning is rarely about a single breakthrough. It is a cumulative process. Eriksson explains, "It's just the idea is probably put into my brain a little bit and then it simmers there for a while and then somehow I remember it and try it out." This organic process, influenced by multiple sources over time, leads to more robust and thoughtful changes in methodology.
    

### The Symbiotic Relationship Between Coaching and Research

A fascinating dynamic explored is that coaching practice is often _ahead_ of published scientific research.

-   **Research Validates Practice:** "Research is quite often trying to... prove the methods that coaches have found out years ago are working." This is a critical concept for athletes and coaches who may believe a method is only valid if it appears in a peer-reviewed journal. Observational data and practical experience from coaching are invaluable and often serve as the precursor to formal investigation.
    
-   **Bridging the Gap:** Podcasters and other media figures play a crucial role in closing this gap. They can ask researchers the "so what" questions:
    
    -   What are the practical applications of this research?
        
    -   What are the limitations of this study?
        
    -   How does this one paper fit into the broader body of evidence? This provides context that is often missing when a layperson reads a single study abstract.
        

## Part 3: The Art and Science of Triathlon Training

This section covers the specific, practical applications of training theory to the unique demands of triathlon.

### Core Principle: Managing Total Load and Intensity

Training for three sports simultaneously requires meticulous management of stress.

-   **Truly Easy Low-Intensity Training:** The foundation of Eriksson's approach is that low-intensity training must be genuinely easy. He often prescribes it based on RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) of 2-3 out of 10, which often corresponds to heart rate Zone 1. This ensures that recovery is maximized and the athlete is prepared for key sessions.
    
-   **Conservative High-Intensity Training:** In contrast to a single-sport athlete who might go "to the well" in a workout, a triathlete's hard workouts are more controlled. The goal is to finish a session "feeling like they could have done more." A session RPE of 7-8 is typical. This prevents the cumulative fatigue from multiple hard sessions across three disciplines from becoming overwhelming.
    
-   **Structured Low-Load Days:** The training week must include days with very little stress, such as a day with only an easy swim, to allow for supercompensation.
    

### Periodization: Beyond Dogma to Individualization

-   **Reverse Periodization:** This model inverts the traditional approach, starting with high-intensity (e.g., VO2max) work and progressing towards more race-specific, lower-intensity volume.
    
    -   **Is it real?** Yes, it is a valid strategy.
        
    -   **Is it optimal?** Not always. Eriksson views it as one tool among many. It can be useful for an athlete who needs to develop their top-end capacity early in the season while they are fresh.
        
    -   **"Gap Analysis" over Models:** The better approach is to perform a "gap analysis": Where is the athlete now? Where do they need to be for their goal race? How do we bridge that gap? This individualized approach may or may not resemble a classic periodization model.
        

### Discipline-Specific Nuances

-   **Rethinking Swim Training:** Eriksson is moving away from traditional swim coaching, which is often derived from pool swimming. He argues this is a mistake for triathletes.
    
    -   **The Problem:** Traditional "endurance" sets (e.g., 40x100m repeats with 10s rest) often end up being performed at a tempo or threshold intensity, not a true low intensity. This adds unintended stress. Hard sets are often "best effort," violating the principle of conservative intensity.
        
    -   **The Solution:** Treat swimming more like running and cycling. This involves **true long, easy endurance swims** (broken into long intervals for mental relief) and more precisely controlled high-intensity work.
        
-   **Running for Cyclists:** This is a high-risk activity. A cyclist's cardiovascular system is far more developed than their musculoskeletal resilience.
    
    -   **The Rule:** "Progress much slower than you think you should be progressing." Bone, tendon, and ligament adaptations take much longer than cardiovascular adaptations.
        
    -   **The Stat:** An estimated **80% of overuse injuries in triathlon come from running**, underscoring the need for extreme caution.
        

### Pacing Long-Distance Events: From Theory to Reality

-   **The Flaw in Percent-of-FTP Rules:** Generic advice like "ride at 85% of FTP for a half-Ironman" is highly problematic. It fails to account for the vast individual differences in fatigue resistance. Some athletes have high short-duration power but fade over time, while others are "diesel engines" who fatigue very little.
    
-   **The Best Predictor:** "The best predictor of performance is performance itself."
    
-   **The Method:** The most reliable way to determine pacing is through **race-specific simulation workouts** performed in a similar environment (heat, terrain) to the target race. For example, a workout of 5x20 minutes at goal half-Ironman effort during a training block gives a strong indication of what is sustainable on race day.
    

## Part 4: Tools, Technology, and Marginal Gains

The discussion addresses the role of technology and the pursuit of small advantages.

-   **A Pragmatic Approach to Technology:** While tools like aero sensors and readiness apps are interesting, they are not the core of training. The fundamentals are "98% of what it is to training." It's crucial to self-experiment with new tools before prescribing them and to set realistic expectations with athletes who may expect a gadget-heavy approach.
    
-   **The Aero "Arms Race":** Aerodynamics has become a major focus in professional and high-level amateur triathlon, similar to cycling time trials. The availability of tools is pushing this trend further into the mainstream.
    
-   **Drafting in Running:** At elite speeds (over 20 km/h), drafting during the run leg of a short-course triathlon provides a significant energy-saving benefit and plays a role in race tactics. This effect diminishes at the slower speeds of long-distance racing unless there is a strong headwind.
    

## Part 5: Debunking and Discussing Common Practices

### A Critical Look at Fasted Training

When asked what training concept he most disagrees with, Eriksson's immediate answer is **fasted training**.

-   **The Rationale:** While lab studies may show certain "signaling advantages," he has "never seen that translate into performance."
    
-   **The Risk:** The potential downsides, such as an increased risk of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S), far outweigh the unproven benefits in his practical experience.
    

### Frequently Asked Questions

-   **Peeing on the bike?** Yes, it happens, and most competitors don't care.
    
-   **Why no socks?** To save time in transition. For races up to Olympic distance, most fast athletes run barefoot in their shoes. For longer races, the risk of blisters makes it a calculated gamble.
    

## Conclusion

The conversation between Moore and Eriksson reveals that high-level coaching is a sophisticated discipline blending foundational scientific principles with an adaptable, critical, and experience-driven philosophy. The key takeaways are that a coach's value lies in their ability to continuously learn, to manage the complex interplay of stress and recovery, to individualize training based on an athlete's unique needs, and to maintain a healthy skepticism toward trends while remaining open to innovation.
