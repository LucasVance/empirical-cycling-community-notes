# Lessons from STAND: Activism, Equality, and the World of Women's Professional Cycling

This document provides a detailed analysis of the key themes and concepts discussed in the Empirical Cycling Podcast interview with Kathryn Bertine, author of "Stand." The conversation offers a masterclass in activism, a candid look at the inequities within professional cycling, and the personal stories that fuel the fight for change.

## Part 1: The Publishing Battle and the Birth of "New Shelf Press"

A central theme at the outset is the significant hurdle Bertine faced in getting her fourth book, "Stand," published. This story serves as a powerful metaphor for the broader struggle for recognition and space that women's stories and achievements face.

-   **The Rejection Narrative:** Despite having three previously successful books with traditional publishers (like ESPN Books and Random House), Bertine's book proposal for "Stand" was rejected by 25 major publishing houses.
    
    -   **The Justification:** The uniform feedback was a market-driven assumption: _"We don't think a book about women who stand up and fight for change is going to sell."_ One publisher explicitly stated, _"There's no room on the shelf. Don't bother."_
        
    -   **The Industry Shift:** Bertine notes a fundamental shift in the publishing industry. Where publishers once sought original content, the modern emphasis is on guaranteed sales, often driven by an author's social media following. This creates a risk-averse environment where unconventional or unprecedented narratives are dismissed because there's no existing sales data to compare them to. This is a classic **Catch-22**: to prove there's a market for such books, they must first be published.
        
-   **Entrepreneurial Activism:** Faced with industry-wide rejection, Bertine had two choices: abandon the project or find another way. True to the book's theme, she chose to fight.
    
    -   **Creating "New Shelf Press":** In a direct and symbolic rebuke to the publisher who claimed there was "no room on the shelf," Bertine founded her own publishing label, **New Shelf Press**. This act transformed a moment of rejection into one of empowerment and creation.
        
    -   **Vindication:** The decision was validated by the book's success. "Stand" went on to outsell her three previous, traditionally published books combined. This success was further amplified when **Spotify** offered her an audiobook deal, recognizing the market that established publishers had failed to see.
        

## Part 2: The Art of Activism: Strategy, Nuance, and "Benevolent Shaming"

The podcast delves deeply into the methodology of effective activism, contrasting it with performative or ineffective "slacktivism."

-   **Three-Dimensional Portrayals:** A key tactic in Bertine's approach, both in writing and negotiation, is to humanize the opposition.
    
    -   **Avoiding Villainization:** Instead of painting figures like "Mr. UCI" or even Lance Armstrong as one-dimensional villains, she explores their complexities. This is a deliberate choice rooted in her own experience of being judged. She argues that looking at all sides of a person or issue—the good and the bad—is essential.
        
    -   **The Power of Gray Areas:** Competitive cycling, she posits, teaches one to be comfortable with ambiguity and contradiction. This mindset is crucial for negotiation, as it allows for finding common ground rather than defaulting to a "good vs. bad" binary.
        
-   **Activism vs. "Slacktivism":**
    
    -   **Slacktivism:** Defined as low-effort, often online-only actions, like tagging an organization on social media and demanding they "do something." It lacks a concrete plan or personal investment.
        
    -   **True Activism:** Involves direct, strategic engagement. For the Women's Tour de France, this meant:
        
        1.  **Face-to-Face Meetings:** Securing a seat at the table with the opposition (ASO - Amaury Sport Organisation, owners of the Tour de France).
            
        2.  **Collaborative Framing:** Presenting the issue not as a demand, but as a mutually beneficial proposal. The question wasn't, "What will you do for us?" but _"How can we together make this happen?"_
            
        3.  **Strategic Compromise:** The initial goal was a multi-stage race, but the group (Le Tour Entier) strategically proposed a one-day race (La Course) to get a "foot in the door." They understood that a small victory was a necessary first step toward the larger goal. This is a classic negotiation tactic of starting with a manageable "ask" to build momentum and prove viability.
            
-   **"Benevolent Shaming":** This is a tool to be used strategically when education and collaboration fail.
    
    -   **The Process:** First, you attempt to educate and appeal to the better nature of the opposition. If they remain resistant, you publicly but professionally expose the inequity.
        
    -   **Example:** When ASO's legal team demanded she remove any mention of the "Tour de France Femme" from her Homestretch Foundation fundraiser (a non-profit supporting the very athletes in their race), she responded by pointing out the hypocrisy: _"Shame on you for picking on a nonprofit that supports women that are in your race."_
        

## Part 3: The Financial and Structural Inequities in Women's Cycling

The conversation lays bare the deep-seated financial and structural disparities that persist in the sport.

-   **The Salary Gap:**
    
    -   For most of her career, Bertine's salary was below the poverty line. Her highest salary, in her final year as a World Tour pro, was $25,000.
        
    -   While progress has been made (World Tour women now have a base salary), it's not parity. The women's World Tour base salary is equivalent to the _men's Pro Continental_ (second-tier) base salary.
        
    -   The Pro Continental level for women, a crucial development step, currently has **no base salary requirement**, creating a system of financial precarity and exploitation.
        
-   **The Sponsorship Disconnect:**
    
    -   **The "Build It, They Will Come" Fallacy (in Promoters' Minds):** Race promoters often fail to invest in women's events, arguing a lack of participants or viewership, without realizing that investment is a prerequisite for that participation and viewership to grow.
        
    -   **The ASO Model:** The men's Tour de France is funded by a massive pool of money from broadcast rights and major sponsors (like Skoda, Vittel). ASO could allocate a portion of this existing pot to the women's race but instead requires the women's event to secure its own, separate title sponsor (Zwift). This frames the women's race as an add-on rather than an integral part of the event.
        
    -   **Prize Money Disparity:** The inequity is glaring. In 2022, the men's Tour de France prize purse was ~$2.2 million. The women's was ~$250,000. Even when comparing the first eight days of the men's race to the eight days of the women's race, the women's prize purse was only **29%** of the men's for the equivalent number of race days.
        
-   **How to Support Change:**
    
    1.  **Patronize Sponsors:** Actively support the companies that sponsor women's teams and races (e.g., Zwift, Trek). Crucially, _let them know_ that their support of women's cycling is the reason for your patronage.
        
    2.  **Local Action:** Approach local race directors and advocate for equal prize money and distances. If they are resistant, go to their sponsors and educate them about the inequality they are funding.
        
    3.  **Direct Advocacy:** Write directly to governing bodies like the UCI to demand changes, such as a base salary for Pro Continental women.
        

## Part 4: Homestretch Foundation and Athlete Welfare

The discussion highlights the practical support systems necessary to counteract the sport's financial instability.

-   **The Mission:** The **Homestretch Foundation** was born from Bertine's own struggles. It provides free housing in Tucson, Arizona, for female pro and pro-continental cyclists, allowing them to train professionally without the burden of rent and utilities.
    
-   **The Impact:** Since 2016, the foundation has helped 88 athletes from 18 countries, including Olympians and Tour de France Femme competitors. It serves as a crucial stepping stone, providing stability at a volatile point in an athlete's career.
    
-   **Advice for Young Cyclists:**
    
    1.  **Know Your Value:** Educate yourself on the financial realities of the sport. Question team structures where management is paid but athletes are not.
        
    2.  **Reject Bullying Tactics:** Be wary of directors who use the threat of replacement ("If you don't race for free, I'll find someone who will") to suppress wages.
        
    3.  **Join the Cyclists' Alliance:** This independent union provides vital support and advocacy for female cyclists, operating outside the direct control of the UCI.
        
    4.  **Be a "Sister Lifter":** Support your teammates and competitors. A rising tide lifts all boats; a stronger, more equitable sport creates more opportunities for everyone.
        

## Part 5: Personal Narratives and Unlikely Alliances

The podcast concludes with a look at the personal stories that intersect with the professional struggle, emphasizing the power of human connection.

-   **The Friendship with Doug Stanhope:** This story is a testament to the idea of looking beyond stereotypes.
    
    -   **The Meeting:** A chance encounter in an airport with the notoriously raunchy comedian.
        
    -   **The Connection:** Stanhope, seeking a quiet place to write, ended up living at the Homestretch house. In a remarkable act of kindness, he took it upon himself to care for Bertine's mother, who had dementia, so her father could take a final vacation.
        
    -   **The Professional Impact:** It was through a fan of Stanhope's who worked at Spotify that "Stand" secured its audiobook deal. This illustrates how an unlikely, genuine friendship created a professional opportunity that the traditional industry had denied her. It is a powerful example of how unpredictable and vital human connections are.
        

This comprehensive overview demonstrates that the fight for a Women's Tour de France was never just about a bike race. It's a case study in strategic activism, economic justice, and the resilience required to carve out space in a world that often says, "there's no room on the shelf."
