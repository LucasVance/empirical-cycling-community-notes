# Strength Periodization for Cyclists: A Detailed Guide

### An Analysis of the Concepts from the Empirical Cycling Podcast

## Introduction

This document provides a structured, in-depth explanation of the concepts discussed in the Empirical Cycling podcast episode on strength periodization. The original content is conversational; this guide organizes it into a clear, pedagogical framework. The core principle discussed is **periodization**: a structured approach to strength training that involves progressing through distinct phases, each with a specific goal, to maximize performance and manage fatigue. This is contrasted with non-periodized or linear progression models (e.g., StrongLifts, Starting Strength) which are often aimed at general strength athletes, not endurance athletes.

## Foundational Concepts

Before diving into the specific phases, it's crucial to understand the underlying principles discussed.

#### 1. The Problem with "Off-the-Shelf" Beginner Programs

-   **Target Audience Mismatch:** Programs like Starting Strength or StrongLifts are designed for strength athletes or those for whom gaining mass is a primary benefit. They prioritize linear progression (adding weight every session) in foundational lifts (e.g., sets of 5 reps).
    
-   **Fatigue Mismanagement for Cyclists:** These programs often prescribe lifting 3-4 times per week, which is unsustainable when combined with serious endurance training. The fatigue generated would cripple on-bike performance.
    
-   **Ignoring a Hypertrophy Phase:** They often jump directly into maximal strength work, skipping a preparatory phase that builds work capacity and connective tissue resilience, which is valuable for cyclists.
    

#### 2. Understanding "Noob Gains"

-   **Definition:** The rapid increase in strength experienced by individuals new to lifting. This is due to both muscular and neurological adaptations.
    
-   **The Cyclist's Context:** The podcast notes that for cyclists, these initial gains transfer very well to the bike, improving sprints, anaerobic capacity, and overall power. However, many cyclists stop their lifting block _before_ truly exhausting these initial gains, often when their on-bike training ramps up.
    
-   **The "Tapped Out" Misconception:** In pure strength programs, "noob gains" are considered exhausted when you can no longer add weight every session. For a cyclist lifting for 2-3 months, this point is rarely reached, meaning there's still adaptive potential.
    

## The Periodization Model: A Phased Approach

The podcast outlines a multi-phase model designed to build strength and then translate it to on-bike performance while integrating with an annual cycling plan.

### Phase 1: Adaptation

-   **Goal:** Neuromuscular re-acclimatization, technique reinforcement, and preparing connective tissues for heavier loads. The primary aim is to get the body used to the movements again without causing debilitating soreness.
    
-   **Duration:** Approximately 2-3 weeks, or 4-5 gym sessions. The phase ends when you no longer experience crippling Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS).
    
-   **Training Parameters:**
    
    -   **Reps:** 8-12 per set.
        
    -   **Load:** Light. The focus is on perfect form, not weight. A little weight is better than just the bar, as it helps with balance.
        
    -   **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion):** 4-6 out of 10. You should never be worried about completing a set.
        
    -   **Key Focus:** Full range of motion (e.g., deep squats) to re-establish mobility.
        
-   **Soreness Management:** The hosts emphasize that DOMS is worst at 48 hours, not 24. Adequate protein and carbohydrate intake post-session is critical to mitigate this.
    

### Phase 2: Hypertrophy

-   **Goal:** To increase the muscle's work capacity and induce a small amount of muscle growth. For cyclists, this is not about "bodybuilding" but about preparing the muscles for the subsequent strength phase.
    
-   **Duration:** 3-4 weeks.
    
-   **Training Parameters:**
    
    -   **Sets:** 3-5 per exercise.
        
    -   **Reps:** 8-15 per set.
        
    -   **Load:** Moderate.
        
-   **Key Considerations for Cyclists:**
    
    -   **Weight Gain:** The hosts debunk the fear of gaining significant weight. Most initial weight gain is from increased glycogen and water storage in the muscles, not contractile tissue. It's nearly impossible to "accidentally" gain large amounts of performance-hindering muscle mass in this short timeframe.
        
    -   **Integration with Cycling:** This phase pairs exceptionally well with **low-intensity, base-building** aerobic work. The fatigue from lifting is manageable, and it doesn't conflict with high-intensity bike sessions (which you shouldn't be doing at this time anyway).
        

### Phase 3: Maximal Strength

-   **Goal:** To increase the central nervous system's ability to recruit motor units and produce maximal force. This is where you get "stronger" in the traditional sense.
    
-   **Duration:** 3-4 weeks.
    
-   **Training Parameters:**
    
    -   **Reps:** 4-6 per set for primary lifts. Accessory work can remain in higher rep ranges.
        
    -   **Load:** Heavy.
        
    -   **RPE:** High, approaching 8-9.5 on the final sets.
        
-   **Key Considerations:**
    
    -   **High Fatigue:** This phase generates the most significant fatigue. It is critical to manage overall training load.
        
    -   **Conflict with Intensity:** This does **not** pair well with high-intensity on-bike training like threshold or VO2 max intervals. Attempting both simultaneously often leads to failed workouts on the bike, as lifting provides a clear binary pass/fail that reveals your true recovery state.
        

### Phase 4: Maintenance (In-Season)

-   **Goal:** To retain the strength and neuromuscular adaptations gained during the off-season with the minimum effective dose of stimulus, preserving recovery resources for racing and on-bike training.
    
-   **Duration:** Throughout the competitive season.
    
-   **Frequency:** Once a week or even once every two weeks.
    
-   **Training Parameters:**
    
    -   **Volume:** Very low (e.g., 2 sets per exercise).
        
    -   **Reps:** 5-10 per set.
        
    -   **Load:** Significantly reduced (approx. 60-70% of 1-rep max).
        
    -   **RPE:** 6-7 out of 10. Sessions should feel easy and are "technique-focused."
        
-   **Practical Application:** The hosts suggest a maintenance lift can be done even after a long 5-6 hour ride, demonstrating how non-fatiguing it should be. The primary goal is to send a signal to the body to preserve muscle mass, which is heavily supported by maintaining high protein intake.
    

### Phase 5: Specificity (Neural Drive & Single-Leg Focus)

-   **Goal:** To maximize the transfer of strength to the bike by focusing on movements that are more specific to the single-leg nature of pedaling and by maximizing neural recruitment.
    
-   **Duration:** 2-4 weeks, typically leading into the pre-competitive season.
    
-   **Key Change in Structure:**
    
    -   Instead of leading with bilateral exercises (like back squats), workouts begin with the most specific and neurologically demanding exercises.
        
    -   **Day 1 Example:** Start with heavy **single-leg squats**, followed by bilateral accessories.
        
    -   **Day 2 Example:** Start with a heavy **deadlift** (trap bar is recommended for its better biomechanics and safety), which is excellent for raw neural drive as it has no eccentric loading phase.
        
-   **The Bilateral Deficit:** This phase directly addresses the phenomenon where the sum of force from two individual limbs working separately is greater than the force they can produce working together. By strengthening each leg independently, you improve the force you can apply to each pedal stroke, which has a more direct correlation to cycling power than bilateral squat strength.
    
-   **Integration:** As this phase is highly specific, it's often done with a reduced frequency (e.g., once per week) to allow for high-quality, high-intensity work on the bike.
    

## Overarching Themes & Practical Advice

#### Nutrition and Recovery

-   **Protein:** Consuming adequate protein (e.g., 20g every 4 hours) is essential for recovery, mitigating soreness, and maintaining muscle mass during the season.
    
-   **Carbohydrates:** Post-lift carbohydrate intake (70-100g mentioned) is crucial for replenishing glycogen stores. The kilojoule expenditure of lifting is low, but the metabolic cost and recovery demand are high.
    

#### Deload Weeks

-   A "deload" is a planned recovery week within a strength block, analogous to a rest week in cycling.
    
-   **Two Methods:**
    
    1.  Cut the number of reps per set in half.
        
    2.  Cut the weight on the bar in half (this is the recommended method for stronger lifters).
        
-   This is critical for allowing connective tissues (tendons, ligaments), which have less blood flow, to recover and adapt.
    

#### Plyometrics

-   The hosts are generally not in favor of plyometrics (e.g., box jumps) for most cyclists.
    
-   **Reasoning:** The benefit (the "squeeze") is not worth the risk and required adaptation time (the "juice"). The ultra-short ground contact time trained by plyos does not transfer well to the longer force application time in a pedal stroke.
    
-   **The Exception:** Low-impact plyos like jump rope can be beneficial for bone density and joint health.
    

## Conclusion

The podcast advocates for a thoughtful, periodized approach to strength training that is subservient to the primary goal of being a better cyclist. It moves from general adaptation to specific, transferable strength, with each phase timed to complement the corresponding phase of an annual aerobic training plan. The key takeaway is to manage fatigue, prioritize recovery, and understand that the goal is not to become a powerlifter, but to use the gym as a tool to enhance on-bike performance.
